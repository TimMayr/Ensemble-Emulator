# Test Configuration: Memory Condition Stop
# Tests stopping when a memory condition is met
#
# Usage: nes_main -c docs/examples/test_memory_condition.toml --rom <test_rom.nes>
#
# Note: This config expects a ROM that writes 0x80 to address 0x6000 to signal test completion.
# Many NES test ROMs use this convention.

[memory]
# Dump test result area
