## SNES Adaptor

Is there any reason one couldn't connect the SNES D1 to the NES D3 or D4 line? Or is it just that no SNES accessory used D1, so there's no point? Or is there a definitive reason _not_ to?

    I'm pretty certain that SNES D1 is only used by the multitap, so there's no point. There isn't a reason _not_ to, but the "correct" connection would be to NES D1, if it were available: that's the Famicom multitap's pin. —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 12:39, 24 May 2017 (MDT)
