The drum to sample converter links to a thread which links to a dead link. Has anyone made a backup of the tool ? So we can link to it on nesdev main page or something like that instead ? Bregalad 20:32, 30 October 2010 (UTC) 

Sorry about that. My server's hard drive crashed and I moved to a new provider. I've restored the archive from backup. [Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") 01:38, 31 October 2010 (UTC) 

Great, then maybe we could have a working link ?Bregalad 11:23, 31 October 2010 (UTC) 

Augh, the web server was down. I turned it back on... [Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") 02:30, 1 November 2010 (UTC) 

Good, but I don't see any .exe file or anything in the like in the archive Bregalad 14:03, 5 November 2010 (UTC) 

I never claimed there was, it always was a perl script with some dependencies. [Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") 15:11, 5 November 2010 (UTC) 

OK and how am I supposed to compile/run this on my computer ?? Bregalad 17:25, 5 November 2010 (UTC) 

Under linux, install perl, PDL, and PDL::Audio. Under windows... I dunno, the thread had someone there try to get it working but didn't succeed. I really haven't thought about this for two years. The 'right' solution is to figure out how on earth libfftw works and rewrite it in C, but I haven't bothered. [Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") 22:05, 5 November 2010 (UTC) 

OK Ubuntu currently crashes before booting on my PC (stupid non-working automatic updates) but I'll try re-installing it when I'll have the time for that and hopefully get it working.Bregalad 18:14, 6 November 2010 (UTC)
