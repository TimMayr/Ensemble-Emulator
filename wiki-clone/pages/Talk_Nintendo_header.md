## AxROM, BxROM

What "board type" would be used for the other discrete boards ([AxROM](AxROM.xhtml "AxROM") and [BNROM](INES_Mapper_034.xhtml "BNROM"))? --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 08:02, 4 November 2013 (MST) 

    Sounds like no game using those mappers ever had headers - I might be wrong though. --[Bregalad](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bregalad&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Bregalad \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_Bregalad.xhtml "User talk:Bregalad")) 14:28, 4 November 2013 (MST)
    Of all of the AxROM and BxROM games in GoodNES3.1.4, only the Japanese release of Battletoads has a compliant header. It's marked as UxROM. —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 14:28, 4 November 2013 (MST)
