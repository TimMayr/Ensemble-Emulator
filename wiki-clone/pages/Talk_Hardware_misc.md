Thinking of merging this into the [main reference page](NES_reference_guide.xhtml "NES reference guide"), perhaps under a "miscellaneous" sublist. It's a very small number of links, and IMO a separate page is not warranted here (it just hides the information). I'll go ahead unless someone screams. :) -[Ulfalizer](User_Ulfalizer.xhtml "User:Ulfalizer") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ulfalizer&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Ulfalizer \(page does not exist\)")) 09:12, 25 May 2013 (MDT) 

    I agree it was the right thing to do this time. For future reference, in case it is useful, [transclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:TRANS "wikipedia:WP:TRANS") might be a useful tool —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 11:22, 25 May 2013 (MDT)
