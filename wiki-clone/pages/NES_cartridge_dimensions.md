## NES Cartridge PCB Outline

This outline is based on measurements from a NES-EWROM-01 type cartridge PCB, segmented with cutouts of of other cartridge types. These measurements are measured with vernier calipers with 0.05 mm accuracy, Base measurements assume 0.05 mm grid. Note that this outline also details where the soldermask ends for the card edge.

## Label dimensions

An NES Game Pak label measures roughly 55x97 mm, with the top 7 mm of that in the fold-over. But actual printing will need a bit of extra space for the bleed area. Here's a [template](File_NES_Game_Pak_label_template_png.xhtml "File:NES Game Pak label template.png") showing the approximate size of a label for a standard NES cartridge.
