## Allocation

I think you should really talk to Quietust before allocating a mapper for his not-yet-finished port. —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 00:05, 10 February 2018 (MST) 

    I think the mapper spec has been stable for more than a decade now? What is still in the air? - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 12:35, 19 November 2019 (MST) 

    Quietust had officially wanted no mapper # assigned. I don't know if that changed in light of NES2.0. —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 14:14, 19 November 2019 (MST) 

    The question is whether a mapper number assignment should really be subject to the approval of the mapper's designer. It's obviously not something that is followed for non-homebrew mappers, and it's at least not self-evident to me why it should be followed for homebrew ones. This question exists with regards to other homebrew circuit boards as well that so far have no wiki page.
