# FAM-NET Keyboard

From [NESdev Wiki](Nesdev_Wiki.xhtml) | View [current version](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/FAM-NET_Keyboard) | View [other pages](Special_AllPages.xhtml#FAM_NET_Keyboard)

The FAM-NET Keyboard is a stripped-down [Family BASIC Keyboard](Family_BASIC_Keyboard.xhtml "Family BASIC Keyboard") intended for use with the FAM-NET modem. It has only 16 keys and no support for the [Family BASIC Data Recorder](Family_BASIC_Data_Recorder.xhtml "Family BASIC Data Recorder"), but is otherwise functionally identical. The mapping from FAM-NET keys to Family BASIC keys is as follows: 
    
    
    FAM-NET Keyboard | Family BASIC Keyboard
    -----------------+----------------------
                LINE | F1
                   ← | ←
                   • | .
                  EB | F7
                   0 | 0
                   1 | 1
                   2 | 2
                   3 | 3
                   4 | 4
                   5 | 5
                   6 | 6
                   7 | 7
                   8 | 8
                   9 | 9
                   * | SPACE
                   # | RETURN
    

The FAM-NET I and II modems both come with a keyboard. They are believed to be the same, but this has not been confirmed. This information is based on the FAM-NET I version.
