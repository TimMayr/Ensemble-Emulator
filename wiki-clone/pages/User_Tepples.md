    * _[RHDE: Furniture Fight](User_Tepples_RHDE.xhtml "User:Tepples/RHDE")_ , a comical real-time strategy game
    * A port of _[robotfindskitten](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=Robotfindskitten&action=edit&redlink=1 "Robotfindskitten \(page does not exist\)")_ , a Zen simulator resembling an Easter egg hunt

  * Multicart engines 
    * [Forbidden Four](Forbidden_Four.xhtml "Forbidden Four"), early MMC1 multicart engine
    * [Action 53](Action_53.xhtml "Action 53"), flexible multicart engine for discrete games, for which I designed [a custom mapper](Action_53_mapper.xhtml "Action 53 mapper")
  * Test ROMs 
    * Mapper-specific tests: BNTest (oversize [BNROM](INES_Mapper_034.xhtml "BNROM") and [AOROM](AxROM.xhtml "AOROM")), Test28 (Action 53 mapper), and tests for [FME-7](Sunsoft_FME_7.xhtml "FME-7") timer and WRAM bank switching
    * Controller tests: Zap Ruder (Zapper), Vaus Test ([Arkanoid controller](Arkanoid_controller.xhtml "Arkanoid controller")), Eighty ([Four Score](Four_player_adapters.xhtml "Four Score")), spadtest ([Super NES controller](Standard_controller.xhtml "Standard controller") on NES), and a multi-controller test that began as an open bus behavior test, but not [these](User_Tepples_Untested_controllers.xhtml "User:Tepples/Untested controllers")
    * Holy Mapperel, a multi-mapper test that works unchanged on a dozen different mappers
    * ca65 project templates for NES NROM, NES UNROM/SGROM/SNROM, and Super NES LoROM
    * [240p test suite](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=240p_test_suite&action=edit&redlink=1 "240p test suite \(page does not exist\)"), which tests the TV or upscaler connected to the video output
  * [Pently](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=Pently&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pently \(page does not exist\)"), an audio engine designed for small ROM footprint without sacrificing power



I'm currently working on a commercial NES project. After that possibly are "Corral", "Fizzbuzz", "Wrecking Ball Boy" and the "Reptile" project.
