I think the game shouldbe a platformer where you use glue in creative ways to reach the end of a level (i.e create ad hoc glue platforms and bridges, build pushable glue blobs to climb and use hot glue to stick enemy RGB PPUs and PCBs in place or it should be an RPG about the struggle of Drakon and how he must over come the mean evil bullies on youtube and various forums with his giant glue "buster" gun ala FF7. 

## Reformed?
