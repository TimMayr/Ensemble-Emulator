It appears some people like to put a low-end gaming [PC in an NES case](http://www.google.com/search?q=nes+pc). Someone on the board was planning one and [asked](http://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?p=65802#p65802) how to hold the Game Pak slot's door open when the CD tray is out. I guess one would start by adding a projecting piece somewhat like this to the door so that the tray can push the door open.
