# 2A03

From [NESdev Wiki](Nesdev_Wiki.xhtml) | View [current version](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/2A03) | View [other pages](Special_AllPages.xhtml#2A03)

The 2A03, short for RP2A03, is the common name of the NTSC [NES CPU](CPU.xhtml "CPU") chip. It consists of a MOS Technology 6502 processor (lacking decimal mode) and audio, joypad, and DMA functionality. PAL systems use the similar RP2A07, which has a different clock rate, adjusted sampled audio rates, and DMA bugfixes. 

## 2A03 register map

In addition to the registers in the 6502 core, the 2A03 contains 22 memory-mapped registers for sound generation (see [NES APU](APU.xhtml "APU")), joystick reading, and OAM DMA transferring. Unlike the addresses of [PPU](PPU.xhtml "PPU") registers and [mapper](Mapper.xhtml "MMC") registers, CPU register addresses are completely decoded, which means that the entire space from the end of CPU registers to the top of address space ($4020 through $FFFF) is available to the Game Pak. 

The range $4018-$401F does nothing on a retail NES. It was intended for 2A03 functionality that never made it to production. Various revisions of the 2A03 include [test registers](CPU_Test_Mode.xhtml "CPU Test Mode") (which are disabled in normal operation) or [remnants of an incompletely implemented IRQ counter](RP2A03_Programmable_Interval_Timer.xhtml "RP2A03 Programmable Interval Timer") that was disconnected from the rest of the circuit. Mappers can place writable registers here without conflicting with the 2A03, but placing readable registers here should be avoided because of [conflicts with DMA](DMA.xhtml#Register_conflicts "DMA").
