## Welcome to NESdev Wiki

Thank you for your contributions to [Game bugs](Game_bugs.xhtml "Game bugs"). I was just curious about a couple things: Are you also [PGCX864 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/PGCX864/videos)? And what is your native language? --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 18:18, 12 May 2015 (MDT) 

Since the native language is Japanese, I have translated from Japanese to English by Google translation.
