    This is a near-duplicate of [INES Mapper 227](INES_Mapper_227.xhtml "INES Mapper 227"), as the Waixing 242 games do set all the bits defined in Mapper 227 that make it behave like 242's description. I'd say Mapper 227 should be regarded as the actual multicart mapper with CHR-RAM protection and a DIP switch, while Mapper 242 would then be the Waixing version without CHR-RAM protect but with WRAM.

    Oh, and the Waixing board name is "FW01", for what it's worth.

    And the 2-in-1 multicart 文字广场 + 排雷 (Wénzì Guǎngchǎng + Páiléi), for some reason romanized as "Gaau Hok Gwong Cheung" on the internet, and using the UNIF board name **UNL-43272** , seems to use it as well.
