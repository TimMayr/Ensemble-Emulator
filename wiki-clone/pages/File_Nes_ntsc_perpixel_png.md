A testcard picture, intentionally resembling Philips PM5544, but rendered with NES colors. 

Rendered in 256x240, then pixel-upscaled to 2560x1920, then lanczos-downscaled to 584x480. This method of scaling was chosen to best inhibit aliasing artifacts that are caused by non-integer horizontal scaling ratio. 

This image is part of a set illustrating the differences between palette-and-pixel-based and scanline-and-ntsc-signal-based rendering in NES emulation. This image shows the scanline-and-ntsc-signal-based rendering.
