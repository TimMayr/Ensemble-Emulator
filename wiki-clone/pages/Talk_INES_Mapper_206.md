## Chicken or Egg

Is the Namco 108 really a stripped down MMC3, or is the MMC3 a Nintendo 108 improvement of the Namco chip ? I feel it's the later because I seem to remember Namco games using this mapper came out first. Could someone please verify ?01:16, 18 March 2014 (MDT) 

    The 108 came first. The first draft of the MMC3 documentation dates to 1987-XII-15, while the first 108-using game was released in 1986-VI. The first MMC3-using game seems to be 1988-VI. —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 12:32, 18 March 2014 (MDT)
