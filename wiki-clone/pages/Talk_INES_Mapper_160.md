Currently, FCEUX's source claims that [iNES Mapper 160](INES_Mapper_160.xhtml "INES Mapper 160") represents a board called "SA009" and implements exactly one bit of CHR banking, and is redundant to an undersize [NINA-03](NINA_003_006.xhtml "NINA-003-006") game with 16 KiB CHR and 32 KiB PRG. 

  
If SA009 means _Sachen's_ SA-009 board, that contained _Pyramid_ , and that only has 16 KiB PRG and 8 KiB CHR.
