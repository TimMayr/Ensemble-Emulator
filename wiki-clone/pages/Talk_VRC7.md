## Sound disable in mirroring register

I'm very surprised to hear about this one, as I've never had a problem with disabled audio when hotswapping my VRC7. SW, can you provide more information about this bit? What does it do, specifically? Does it silence audio or does it prevent register writes to the audio unit? - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 06:15, 2 October 2013 (MDT) 

    I asked BootGod to verify it and he did. —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 16:48, 2 October 2013 (MDT)
