_Nintendulator_ is an NES emulator written by [Quietust](User_Quietust.xhtml "User:Quietust") with the original goal of being as accurate and precise as possible, even at the expense of emulation speed; whether that goal is still being attained today is uncertain. It is written in C++ and uses external plugins for mapper support.
