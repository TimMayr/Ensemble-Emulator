Why has this been allocated? There doesn't appear to be any publicly available ROM that requires this. If you are drafting a new mapper on your userspace, that's fine, but don't allocate a slot for it until you've actually made something. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 10:55, 17 April 2015 (MDT) 

    Have de-allocated it, currently redirecting back to [Mapper#Plane 1](Mapper.xhtml#Plane_1 "Mapper"). Feel free to re-allocate it when there is a published ROM that requires it. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 14:14, 24 April 2015 (MDT)
