## Spurious warnings from ABUSE filter

Welcome to NESdev Wiki, and I'm sorry. 

Lately we had a serious spam problem. I tried to put a preventive measure in place afterward. But I realized I had made a mistake in this measure. I apologize for the incorrect warning that NESdev Wiki presented to you. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 21:30, 3 June 2016 (MDT)
