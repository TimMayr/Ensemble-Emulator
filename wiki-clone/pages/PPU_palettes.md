# PPU palettes

From [NESdev Wiki](Nesdev_Wiki.xhtml) | View [current version](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/PPU_palettes) | View [other pages](Special_AllPages.xhtml#PPU_palettes)

The NES has a limited selection of color outputs. A 6-bit value in the palette memory area corresponds to one of 64 outputs. The [emphasis](Colour_emphasis.xhtml "Colour emphasis") bits of the [PPUMASK](PPU_registers.xhtml "PPUMASK") register ($2001) provide an additional color modifier. 

For more information on how the colors are generated on an NTSC NES, see: [NTSC video](NTSC_video.xhtml "NTSC video"). For additional information on how the colors are generated on a PAL NES, see: [PAL video](PAL_video.xhtml "PAL video").

## Palette RAM

| Palette 0  | Palette 1  | Palette 2  | Palette 3   
---|---|---|---|---  
$x0 | $x1 | $x2 | $x3  | $x4 | $x5 | $x6 | $x7  | $x8 | $x9 | $xA | $xB  | $xC | $xD | $xE | $xF   
Background  | $3F0x  | _0*_ | 1 | 2 | 3  | _0_ | 1 | 2 | 3  | _0_ | 1 | 2 | 3  | _0_ | 1 | 2 | 3   
Sprite  | $3F1x  | 1 | 2 | 3  | 1 | 2 | 3  | 1 | 2 | 3  | 1 | 2 | 3   
  
*** Note: Entry 0 of palette 0 is used as the backdrop color.**

Backgrounds and sprites each have 4 palettes of 4 colors, located at $3F00-$3F1F in VRAM. Each byte in this palette RAM contains a 6-bit color value referencing one of the PPU's 64 colors. Entry 0 of each palette is unique in that it is transparent, so its color value is normally unused. However, because of the PPU's [EXT functionality](PPU_rendering.xhtml#Drawing_overview "PPU rendering"), entry 0 of palette 0 has the unique behavior of being the _backdrop color_. The backdrop color is the single color shown behind both the background and sprites, wherever both layers are transparent. Artistically, the backdrop color is usually considered a fourth color of the background and is sometimes called the _universal background color_. 

A single element on the screen can only use a single palette. For backgrounds, this is usually a [16x16 pixel region](PPU_attribute_tables.xhtml "PPU attribute tables"), but may be as small as an 8x1 pixel _sliver_ with assistance from a cartridge mapper. For sprites, this is a single sprite object, which is [8x8 or 8x16 pixels](PPU_OAM.xhtml#Byte_2 "PPU OAM"), depending on the current sprite size. The palette is selected with a 2-bit value referred to as _attributes_. 

Ultimately, the color of a pixel is determined by background vs sprite (which selects the set of 4 palettes), the 2 bits of attributes (which select 1 of those 4 palettes), and the 2 bits of graphics or tile _pattern_ data (which select the color from that palette). These create a 5-bit index into palette RAM: 
    
    
    4bit0
    -----
    SAAPP
    |||||
    |||++- Pixel value from tile pattern data
    |++--- Palette number from attributes
    +----- Background/Sprite select
    

Note that entry 0 of each palette is also unique in that its color value is shared between the background and sprite palettes, so writing to either one updates the same internal storage. This means that the backdrop color can be written through both $3F00 and $3F10. Palette RAM as a whole is also [mirrored](Mirroring.xhtml#Memory_Mirroring "Mirroring") through the entire $3F00-$3FFF region. 

## Color Value Significance (Hue / Value)

As in some second-generation game consoles, values in the NES palette are based on [hue and brightness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV "wikipedia:HSL and HSV"): 
    
    
    5 bit 0
    -------
    VV HHHH
    || ||||
    || ++++- Hue (phase, determines NTSC/PAL chroma)
    ++------ Value (voltage, determines NTSC/PAL luma)
    

Hue $0 is light gray, $1-$C are blue to red to green to cyan, $D is dark gray, and $E-$F are mirrors of $1D (black). 

It works this way because of the way colors are represented in a composite NTSC or PAL signal, with the phase of a color subcarrier controlling the hue. For details regarding signal generation and color decoding, see [NTSC video](NTSC_video.xhtml "NTSC video"). 

The canonical code for "black" is $0F. 

The 2C03 RGB PPU used in the PlayChoice-10 and 2C05-99 in the Famicom Titler renders hue $D as black, not dark gray. The 2C04 PPUs used in many [Vs. System](Vs__System.xhtml "Vs. System") arcade games have completely different palettes as a copy protection measure. 

## Palettes

The 2C02 (NTSC) and 2C07 (PAL) PPU is used to generate an analog composite video signal. These were used in most home consoles. 

The 2C03, 2C04, and 2C05, on the other hand, all output analog red, green, blue, and sync (RGBS) signals. The sync signal contains horizontal and vertical sync pulses in the same format as an all-black composite signal. Each of the three video channels uses a 3-bit DAC driven by a look-up table in a 64x9-bit ROM inside the PPU. The look-up tables (one digit for each of red, green, and blue, in order) are given below. 

RGB PPUs were used mostly in arcade machines (e.g. [Vs. System](Vs__System.xhtml "Vs. System"), Playchoice 10), as well as the Sharp Famicom Titler. 

### 2C02

The RF Famicom, AV Famicom, NES (both front- and top-loading), and the North American version of the Sharp Nintendo TV use the 2C02 PPU. Unlike some other consoles' video circuits, the 2C02 does not generate RGB video and then encode that to composite. Instead it generates [NTSC video](NTSC_video.xhtml "NTSC video") directly in the composite domain, decoded by the television receiver into RGB to drive its picture tube. 

![](../wiki-images/Ambox_content.png) |  Do not use color $0D. It results in a "blacker than black" signal that may cause problems for some TVs.

Further details on $0D and its effects can be found [here.](Color__0D_games.xhtml "Color $0D games")  
---|---  
  
Most emulators can use a predefined palette, such as one commonly stored in common [.pal](_pal.xhtml ".pal") format, in which each triplet represents the sRGB color that results from decoding a large flat area with a given palette value. 

See [this page](NTSC_video.xhtml#Composite_decoding "NTSC video") for more details on a general algorithm to decode a PPU composite signal to color RGB.

Other tools for generating a palette include [one by Bisqwit](http://bisqwit.iki.fi/utils/nespalette.php) and [one by Drag](http://drag.wootest.net/misc/palgen.html). These simulate generating a large area of one flat color and then decoding that with the adjustment knobs set to various settings. 

### 2C07

The PAL PPU (2C07) generates a composite [PAL video](PAL_video.xhtml "PAL video") signal, which has a -15 degree hue shift relative to the 2C02 due to a different colorburst reference phase generated by the PPU ($x7 rather than $x8), in addition to the PAL colorburst phase being defined as -U ± 45 degrees.

### 2C03 and 2C05

This palette is intentionally similar to the NES's standard palette, but notably is missing the greys in entries $2D and $3D. The 2C03 is used in _Vs. Duck Hunt_ , _Vs. Tennis_ , all PlayChoice games, and the Sharp C1 (Famicom TV). The 2C05 is used in some later Vs. games as a copy protection measure. A variant of the 2C05 without copy protection measures is present in the Sharp Famicom Titler, albeit with adjustments to the output (see below). Both have historically been used in RGB mods for the NES, as a circuit implementing `A0' = A0 xor (A1 nor A2)` can swap PPUCTRL and PPUMASK to make a 2C05 behave as a 2C03. 

The formula for mapping the DAC integer channel value to 8-bit per channel color is `C = 255 * DAC / 7`.

$2x  | 777  | 357  | 447  | 637  | 707  | 737  | 740  | 750  | 660  | 360  | 070  | 276  | 077  | 000  | 000  | 000   
$3x  | 777  | 567  | 657  | 757  | 747  | 755  | 764  | 772  | 773  | 572  | 473  | 276  | 467  | 000  | 000  | 000   
  
Note that some of the colors are duplicates: $0B and $1A = 040, $2B and $3B = 276. 

Monochrome works the same as the 2C02 (consistent across **all** RGB PPUs), but unlike the 2C02, emphasis on the RGB chips works differently; rather than "darkening" the specific color chosen, it sets the corresponding channel to full brightness instead. 

### 2C05-99

The Sharp Famicom Titler (AN-510) contains a RC2C05-99 PPU, whose RGB output is fed into a X0858CE "encoder" chip. This chip handles the conversion from RGB(S) into Composite, and S-Video. In the process, it seems to also desaturate the output palette by encoding YIQ, but with a 0.5 gain on the Q channel (`Q = Q * 0.5`). Otherwise, the raw internal palette of the 2C05-99 PPU itself is believed to be identical to that of the 2C03. Due to technological limitations with video overlay (at the time), this was likely done in an attempt to make the RGB palette resemble its composite versions, as a standard 2C02 could not be used.

### 2C04

All four 2C04 PPUs contain the same master palette, but in different permutations. It's almost a superset of the 2C03/5 palette, adding four greys, six other colors, and making the bright yellow more pure. 

Much like the 2C03 and 2C02, using the greyscale bit in [PPUMASK](PPU_registers.xhtml "PPUMASK") will remap the palette by index, not by color. This means that with the scrambled palettes, each row will remap to the colors in the $0X column for that 2C04 version. 

Visualization tool: [RGB PPU Palette Converter](https://www.nesdev.org/rgbppu/)

**No version of the 2C04 was ever made with the below ordering** , but it shows the similarity to the 2C03: 

333  | 014  | 006  | 326  | 403  | 503  | 510  | 420  | 320  | 120  | 031  | 040  | 022  | 111  | 003  | 020   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
555  | 036  | 027  | 407  | 507  | 704  | 700  | 630  | 430  | 140  | 040  | 053  | 044  | 222  | 200  | 310   
777  | 357  | 447  | 637  | 707  | 737  | 740  | 750  | 660  | 360  | 070  | 276  | 077  | 444  | 000  | 000   
777  | 567  | 657  | 757  | 747  | 755  | 764  | 770  | 773  | 572  | 473  | 276  | 467  | 666  | 653  | 760   
  
The [PPUMASK](PPU_registers.xhtml "PPUMASK") monochrome bit has the same implementation as on the 2C02, and so it has an unintuitive effect on the 2C04 PPUs; rather than forcing colors to grayscale, it instead forces them to the first column.

#### Games compatible with multiple different PPUs

Some games don't require that arcade owners have the correct physical PPU. 

At the very least, the following games use some of the DIP switches to support multiple different PPUs: 

  * Atari RBI Baseball
  * Battle City
  * Star Luster
  * Super Sky Kid
  * Super Xevious
  * Tetris (Tengen)
  * TKO Boxing



#### LUT approach

Emulator authors may implement the 2C04 variants as a LUT indexing the "ordered" palette. This has the added advantage of being able to use preexisting .pal files if the end user wishes to do so. 

Repeating colors such as 000 and 777 may index into the same entry of the "ordered" palette, as this is functionally identical.

## Backdrop color

The backdrop color ($3F00) is shown wherever backgrounds and sprites are both transparent, as well as in the [border region](PPU_rendering.xhtml#Drawing_overview "PPU rendering") on NTSC and RGB PPUs. When only one of background or sprite rendering is disabled, the disabled component is treated as transparent. Disabling components in the left column via [PPUMASK](PPU_registers.xhtml#PPUMASK "PPU registers") also treats them as transparent there. 

### Backdrop override

When both background and sprite rendering are disabled, this is called forced blank. During forced blank, the PPU normally draws the backdrop color. However, if the current VRAM address in [v](PPU_registers.xhtml#Internal_registers "PPU registers") points into palette RAM ($3F00-$3FFF), then the color at that address will be drawn, instead, overriding the backdrop color. This can allow the CPU to deliberately select colors to draw to the screen, including in the border region, for effects such as color bars or to draw more colors on the screen than is possible during rendering. It can also be used to show the normally-unused transparent colors in $3Fx4/$3Fx8/$3FxC. 

More commonly, though, backdrop override results in a glitch where updating palettes outside of vblank causes the palette to be briefly drawn on the screen. Because of this, palette updates should be timed to occur during [vblank](The_frame_and_NMIs.xhtml "The frame and NMIs"). Backdrop override can also occur naturally based on scroll position if v points into palette RAM when rendering disables, usually resulting in colors flashing in the 2 scanlines of border at the bottom of the screen. Fortunately, this border flashing is normally hidden by [overscan](Overscan.xhtml "Overscan"). 

Backdrop override is not a deliberate PPU feature, but rather a side effect of how palette RAM is addressed. Palette RAM has just one address input, which is normally the address produced by the rendering hardware. However, when palettes are written by the CPU, it instead needs to use the CPU's target address. The PPU draws whatever color is output from palette RAM, so changing the address to allow CPU access also changes the color drawn to the screen. This is similar to color RAM dots on some Sega consoles, but occurs continuously rather than just during the CPU access. 

## Color names

When programmers and artists are communicating, it's often useful to have human-readable names for colors. Many graphic designers who have done web or game work will be familiar with [HTML color names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#HTML_color_names "wikipedia:Web colors"). 

### Luma

  * $0F: Black
  * $00: Dark gray
  * $10: Light gray or silver
  * $20: White
  * $01-$0C: Dark colors, medium mixed with black
  * $11-$1C: Medium colors, similar brightness to dark gray
  * $21-$2C: Light colors, similar brightness to light gray
  * $31-$3C: Pale colors, light mixed with white



### Chroma

Names for hues: 

  * $x0: Gray
  * $x1: Azure
  * $x2: Blue
  * $x3: Violet
  * $x4: Magenta

  * $xB: Spring
  * $xC: Cyan



### RGBI

These NES colors approximate colors in 16-color RGBI palettes, such as the CGA, EGA, or classic Windows palette, though the NES doesn't really have particularly good approximations: 

  * $0F: 0/Black
  * $02: 1/Navy
  * $1A: 2/Green
  * $1C: 3/Teal
  * $06: 4/Maroon
  * $14: 5/Purple
  * $18: 6/Olive ($17 for the brown in CGA/EGA in RGB)
  * $10: 7/Silver
  * $00: 8/Gray
  * $12: 9/Blue
  * $2A: 10/Lime
  * $2C: 11/Aqua/Cyan
  * $16: 12/Red
  * $24: 13/Fuchsia/Magenta
  * $28: 14/Yellow
  * $30: 15/White
