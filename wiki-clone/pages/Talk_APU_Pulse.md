Is the pulse timer simply clocked by CPU/2 ("APU clock") internally? Looks that way in Visual 2A03 (the timer is only 11 bits wide), only I can't get the timer to count down for some reason. Might be informative to have the hw reality on this page. -[Ulfalizer](User_Ulfalizer.xhtml "User:Ulfalizer") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ulfalizer&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Ulfalizer \(page does not exist\)")) 18:35, 28 April 2013 (MDT) 

  * My bad - I was watching the wrong node in Visual 2A03. Looks like it's indeed using the APU clock. -[Ulfalizer](User_Ulfalizer.xhtml "User:Ulfalizer") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ulfalizer&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Ulfalizer \(page does not exist\)")) 19:26, 28 April 2013 (MDT)
