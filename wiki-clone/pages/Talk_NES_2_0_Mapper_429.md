Why initial PRG bank 1? —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 16:28, 13 November 2021 (UTC) 

With the exception of the "initial PRG bank 1", this definition matches the mapper of a LIKO 12-in-1 multicart that I have not assigned yet exactly, except that it has CHR-RAM instead of CHR-ROM. —[NewRisingSun](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:NewRisingSun&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:NewRisingSun \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_NewRisingSun.xhtml "User talk:NewRisingSun")) 20:43, 13 November 2021 (UTC) 

For compatibility with [GNROM](GxROM.xhtml "GNROM"), A15 (from the user's point of view) is inverted, the firmware for initializing CHR is stored on page 1/5/9/13, and the PRG is on page 0/4/8/12. --[Milowork](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Milowork&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Milowork \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Milowork&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Milowork \(page does not exist\)")) 21:12, 27 December 2021 (UTC) 

    The LIKO 12-in-1 multicart works fine even with initial PRG bank 1, so good with me. ;) —[NewRisingSun](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:NewRisingSun&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:NewRisingSun \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_NewRisingSun.xhtml "User talk:NewRisingSun")) 23:49, 28 December 2021 (UTC)
