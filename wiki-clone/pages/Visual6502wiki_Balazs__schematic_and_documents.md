Beregnyei Balazs (family name first!) derived a schematic from his die photo and wrote up notes on the circuits. 

The chip is an R6502 which is a Rockwell part but uses MOS Technology's masks. 

Henry S. Courbis worked with a friend of Balazs on an English translation

Balazs gave a 40 minute presentation on the reverse engineering at Hacktivity 2011, see [here](https://vimeo.com/33077354) (original Hungarian) and [here](https://vimeo.com/34650139) (English voiceover).
