# User:Zzo38/Submappers

This file lists my own suggestions for submappers. Please feel free to edit it if you have something to add. People who then make officially submapper numbers of NES 2.0 can decide to use some of all of these suggestion if you want to. 

I will add DotFami mapper codes (for .cart files and ines.map file) when I am able to. 

Note: In all cases with mapper numbers 0 to 255 (even numbers not yet assigned), submapper 0 means to determine using hashes/checksum or whatever as old iNES files are treated. This is for compatibility purposes. Mapper numbers 256 and above do not use submapper 0 in this way. 

Some files use incorrect mapper numbers, or other incorrect things in the header. If iNES 2.0 headers are used, assume the header is correct. 

**N.B. This is not the official list; it is kept temporarily since official list is incomplete. Some of these things have been overridden by the official list.**
