I still run Windows XP in 2017 and it won't gonna change soon. :) 

    I use Windows 7 and linux and I consider reversing to XP (or 2k which was better) so much 7 is annoying. If I'm going to use something obsolete anyway I might at least use something good.[Bregalad](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bregalad&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Bregalad \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_Bregalad.xhtml "User talk:Bregalad")) 14:01, 20 September 2017 (MDT)
