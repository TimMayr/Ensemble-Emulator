Here is how this mess came about: FCEUX emulates subtype 2 when encountering Mapper 215 or UNIF **UNL-8237** , which covers Subtype 4 as well because of its compatibility writes, and subtype 3 only when encountering UNIF **UNL-8237A**. Subtype 1 is not supported. Nestopia on the other hand emulates subtype 4 when encountering Mapper 215 with PRG=256K and CHR=512K (an overdump of _Mortal Kombat 3 Extra 60_), subtype 1 when encountering Mapper 215 with other ROM sizes, subtype 2 only when encountering UNIF **UNL-8237** , and subtype 3 not at all; all excluding CRC-based reassignments. Comments appreciated on whether submappers are needed/desired for this.
