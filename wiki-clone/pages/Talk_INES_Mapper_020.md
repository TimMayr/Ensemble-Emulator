I suggest that if an emulator loads a ROM image with this mapper number, it treats it as the FDS BIOS ROM (ignoring any other FDS BIOS ROM image the emulator has) and loads it with no disk inserted, accepting .QDI format disk images (possibly .FDS as well, but if so there needs to be a way to select more than one and to have it active together with the .NES ROM image). --[Zzo38](User_Zzo38.xhtml "User:Zzo38") ([talk](User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml "User talk:Zzo38")) 22:18, 21 April 2013 (MDT)
