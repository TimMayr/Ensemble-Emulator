For the solder pads, what are the actual connections established in each mode? --[Quietust](User_Quietust.xhtml "User:Quietust") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Quietust&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Quietust \(page does not exist\)")) 09:56, 30 March 2013 (MDT) 

    At least SL/CL 3-6 are described in [MMC5 pinout](MMC5_pinout.xhtml "MMC5 pinout").
    SL/CL 1 and 2 connect Vbackup vs Vcc to the RAMs
    For NES-ETROM, no-one mentions what SL/CL 15 does, and NesCartDB doesn't have a picture of the reverse. It's something to do with audio, though.—[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 14:12, 30 March 2013 (MDT)
