"Myask": It is pronounced like "mask" except with the first sound of "meow"(miau), a ミャ. It's not "my ask". 

I have used to some degree or other various BASICs, an assembly lang or two, Verilog, HDL, LOGO, some LISP[-family], various C-families. In addition to English, I know/have studied German, Japanese, and French. 

I enjoy philosophy, theorycrafting and arcane details, most of the time. I find unofficial opcodes neat, and am still using hex editor(s) to program my NES projects.

Everdrive implemented: 212(in Nestopia only "BMC_SUPERHIK_300IN1 = MakeId< 212,") [off 174], have added [219](INES_Mapper_219.xhtml "INES Mapper 219") (in FCEUX) 

Add own mapper implementations, do more mapper implementations, add mapper spreadsheet wikiexport 

## Quotes about me

"I feel like this post was written by some kind of automated nesdev post bot. It contains words that you would find in a typical post, but not in any order that makes any sense to me." \--dougeff
