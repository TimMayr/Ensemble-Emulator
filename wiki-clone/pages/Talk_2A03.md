## Formatting

When I [made this reversion](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=2A03&diff=15295&oldid=15293) I didn't realize I wouldn't have a chance to leave a comment: this formatting style is inconsistent with the prevailing styles of this wiki, cumbersome, and in the unicode character cases impossible to type with a keyboard. I don't think it's an appropriate change to make. **Bolding** the addresses with wiki markup would be more in line with other use, perhaps. The em-dash is not something used here, and I don't think it should be. Similarly * is preferred to a unicode multiplication sign elsewhere in the wiki as well. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 14:54, 8 August 2018 (MDT)
