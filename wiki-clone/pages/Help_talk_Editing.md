## Help: namespace

Would other people be ok with it if I got rid of the copy of the Help: namespace that's on nesdevwiki here, and replace what pages we actually need with redirects/links to mediawiki's reference copy? —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 21:01, 10 February 2017 (MST) 

    Seems fine to me. We don't actually have anything in there, do we? But…isn't the "licensing" page in there, even if we haven't got a policy, yet? [Myask](User_Myask.xhtml "User:Myask") ([talk](User_talk_Myask.xhtml "User talk:Myask")) 05:30, 11 February 2017 (MST)
