Tile layer is a program originally for DOS, although recently released for Windows. It is able to take a ROM file and show you all of the graphics that game uses. Those graphics could be altered, flipped, or switched. It also has a nifty feature to open two ROMs at a time, so you could take graphics from one game and throw them directly into the other.
