    Reportedly the $800s bit should be ORed into the 2s bit to select which CHR register is updated.

What does that mean? What is a "$800s bit"? [NewRisingSun](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:NewRisingSun&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:NewRisingSun \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_NewRisingSun.xhtml "User talk:NewRisingSun")) 01:39, 19 August 2017 (MDT) 

    For my best, "$800s" means the binary "1000 0000 0000". Take the "2s" notation for mirroring bit as binary "10" too. --[Zepper](User_Zepper.xhtml "User:Zepper") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zepper&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Zepper \(page does not exist\)")) 05:53, 22 August 2017 (MDT)
