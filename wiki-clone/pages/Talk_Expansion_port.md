## Merged

I merged two articles into this one, so I'm linking here those past discussion pages for convenience: 

  * [Talk:NES expansion port pinout](Talk_NES_expansion_port_pinout.xhtml "Talk:NES expansion port pinout") \- Has a discussion about connector dimensions that might want to be incorporated into the article? Otherwise, a few questions/suggestions that already seem resolved.
  * [Talk:Famicom expansion port pinout](Talk_Famicom_expansion_port_pinout.xhtml "Talk:Famicom expansion port pinout") \- A few clarifying questions/suggesions, probably resolved already?
