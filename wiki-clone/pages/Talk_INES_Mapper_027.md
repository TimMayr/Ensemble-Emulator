VRC4 actually supports 9 pin wide CHR banking, making this look awfully like the VRC4"f" (mapper 23) variant... other than whatever weirdness is going on with the definition of $9002. (Is this 3x8+8F PRG banking or MMC3 style PRG banking?) ... and whether the scanline irq behavior is A12-based or M2-based —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 20:39, 2 March 2013 (MST) 

    The scanline IRQ must be M2-based: the game was re-released in a later version that includes an NTSC/PAL selection screen at the beginning. This would not be necessary if the counter were PA12-based. I do not understand the question about the $9002 register; it seems just like the VRC4's PRG Swap Mode functionality. All in all, it seems to be bog-standard VRC4f to me, and runs perfectly when emulated as such. I propose following FCEUX in using INES Mapper 027 solely for _迷魂車 (Míhúnchē)_ (CC-27) and using Mapper 23.1 for _World Hero_.

    After re-reading the description a number of times, I now understand what is meant by "3x8+8F vs MMC3-style PRG banking" \--- basically, a VRC4 equivalent of [INES Mapper 100](INES_Mapper_100.xhtml "INES Mapper 100").

    Also, whatever led Nestopia to put a copy of the $9002 "geometry" register at $9080?—[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 05:34, 25 May 2019 (MDT)
