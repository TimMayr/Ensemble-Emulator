Thanks for fixing the accidental `.org.org` in the link to my ATT user page. I must have had CNET syndrome that day. 

FYI: What you saw beginning with `[//allthetropes` was called a "protocol-relative link". If you follow a protocol-relative link from an `http:` page, it'll connect to the other server with `http:`, and if you do so from an `https:` page, it'll connect to the other server with `http:`. See [mediawikiwiki:MediaWiki 1.18#Protocol-relative URLs](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.18#Protocol-relative_URLs "mediawikiwiki:MediaWiki 1.18"). --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 14:51, 16 August 2015 (MDT) 

    I do know what protocol-relative URIs are. However, it seems to me that if the protocol is FILE then it might not work (unless MediaWiki takes care of that on the server-side; also that they shouldn't be used between two entirely different sites)...but that is your page and you can fix how you want it to do. --[Zzo38](User_Zzo38.xhtml "User:Zzo38") (talk) 09:37, 18 August 2015 (MDT) 

    You have a good point about `file:` breakage. The next "Offline HTML version" will transform protocol-relative URLs into `http:` URLs. As for the rule "they shouldn't be used between two entirely different sites", is there an RFC or other spec documenting this? --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 12:45, 18 August 2015 (MDT) 

    I don't know; ignore me if I am wrong. --[Zzo38](User_Zzo38.xhtml "User:Zzo38") (talk) 10:40, 19 August 2015 (MDT)
