  * [Chris Smith has captured the netlist](http://www.zxdesign.info/book/insideULA.shtml) of (and written a book on) the Sinclair Spectrum ULA
  * MAME Guru is [working on various locked ROMs](http://guru.mameworld.info/decap/) from arcade games
  * John McMaster has several large images under <http://siliconpr0n.org/archive/doku.php> including slippy maps of several, under <http://siliconpr0n.org/map/> Includes several TI calculator chips. See also [his list of other chip images](https://siliconpr0n.org/archive/doku.php?id=digitized).
