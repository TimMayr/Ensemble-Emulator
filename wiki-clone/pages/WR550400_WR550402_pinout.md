Notes: 

  * Those 2 chips were used in bootleg version of _Moe Pro! Saikyou-hen Baseball_ [[1]](https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=17478), along with pirate VRC4 chip. Original game used Jaleco SS88006 along with D7756C ADPCM Speech Chip [[2]](http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=3980)
  * Each of those 2 chips contains different set of 8 audio samples, used in game.
  * Vendor logo printed on ICs suggest that the manufacturer was Winbond,
  * Forcing rising edge on one of its D0..D7 inputs enables playback adequate audio sample
  * The output "analog" audio has 32-voltage-levels,
  * Along with the analog audio, there is some digital data transmitted on pins 12/11/10
  * Pin 14 is high for the whole time when D2 audio sample is played,
  * Pin 13 goes high for the last 0.5ms when D2 audio sample is played.
