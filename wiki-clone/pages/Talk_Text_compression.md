First, thank you for adding those pages on compression. They are a great idea, and definitely an improvement for the wiki. 

Now, it would be great if you mentionned my program, compress_tools. <http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/882/>

This was written especially with NES games in mind, although it is certainly not restricted to this usage. I do not want to add this myself, as I do not want to do too much self-publicity, and it would be hard to talk about this program with a totally objective point of view. If other compression tools are relevent, please add info about them too. (Bregalad)~~188.60.177.159~~ 13:22, 1 May 2016 (MDT)
