# Talk:PPU power up state

From [NESdev Wiki](Nesdev_Wiki.xhtml) | View [current version](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Talk%3APPU_power_up_state) | View [other pages](Special_AllPages.xhtml#Talk_PPU_power_up_state)

CHR RAM and NT/AT RAM are not part of the PPU, they are typically part of the cartridge and motherboard respectively (although it could be different in some hardware configurations). 

Their power up state should be the same as any other SRAM chip, the main RAM for example.
