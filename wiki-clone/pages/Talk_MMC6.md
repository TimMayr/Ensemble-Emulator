I think we should just redirect this to the [MMC3](MMC3.xhtml "MMC3") page, and on the MMC3 page, we should add a section detailing the differences of the MMC6, since there aren't many. I'll write the differences section here though, and if we go through with this, we can copy it over to the MMC3 page. --[Drag](User_Drag.xhtml "User:Drag") 20:33, 16 April 2011 (UTC) 

    Actually nevermind, new idea, if redirect this page to the MMC3 page, copy the $8000 and $A001 sections over to a "differences with MMC3" section, in addition to a brief explanation of how the WRAM is only 1k, and in two 512-byte halves. Don't forget Blargg's blurb in the hardware section. --[Drag](User_Drag.xhtml "User:Drag") 21:02, 16 April 2011 (UTC)
