Welcome to Nesdev wiki! 

Constructive contributions are welcome, but please don't post [spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spam_\(electronic\) "wikipedia:spam \(electronic\)"). You copied a bunch of off-topic text from [wikipedia:Bride price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_price "wikipedia:Bride price") along with a link to a homework cheating site. That doesn't look constructive. 

**This is your only warning.** If you spam again, you will be [thwomped](http://www.mariowiki.com/Thwomp). --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") 23:17, 15 January 2010 (UTC)
