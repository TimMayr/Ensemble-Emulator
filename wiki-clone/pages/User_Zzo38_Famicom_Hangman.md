Since not all phrases are complete, if you have any suggestion then I will add it on. The length of each one is limited to 32, although it should be limited to 30 so that it doesn't get cut off on edge of TV screen. You can use alphabet, digits, spaces, and punctuation. It could be a single word, or a phrase of multiple words.
