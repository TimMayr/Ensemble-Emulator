Very few boards use a battery to retain the content of CHR-RAM. The purpose of doing so is presumably that if a game already uses CHR-RAM [for other reasons](CHR_ROM_vs__CHR_RAM.xhtml "CHR ROM vs. CHR RAM") and only has a few bytes of save data to retain, storing these bytes in the same CHR-RAM chip (and sacrificing available tile numbers in the process) and connecting a battery to it is more economical than adding a separate WRAM chip. 

[Nintendo's early MMC1 data sheet](http://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=16925) mentions an "SLROM" board with 8 KiB of battery-backed CHR-RAM. The actual [SLROM](SxROM.xhtml "SLROM") board that went into production uses CHR-ROM and no PRG-RAM or CHR-RAM at all.
