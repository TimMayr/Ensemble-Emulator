**Welcome to NESdev Wiki.**

Certain editing patterns are used to [deface wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Vandalism"). Other patterns are used to test whether a wiki accepts anonymous edits, so that an automated process can later come back and deface the same wiki. This wiki restricts such patterns that its administrators have identified. If you plan to make constructive contributions, try making your comment a bit more substantial, and don't forget to [sign your posts on talk pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Signatures "wikipedia:WP:Signatures") with `~~~~`. 

(A brief description of the [ABUSE rule](Nesdev_wiki_ABUSE_filter.xhtml "Nesdev wiki:ABUSE filter") which your action matched is: $1)
