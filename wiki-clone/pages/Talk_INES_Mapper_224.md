## incorrect headers q

Are there a bunch of games marked as [245](INES_Mapper_245.xhtml "INES Mapper 245") that are actually this mapper? —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 00:10, 18 February 2018 (MST) 

    Not really. There are many images incorrectly marked as mapper 245, but actually they're all just normal mapper 4, or for one dump of Zelda 1, mapper 176. There is one hacked version of Zelda 1 that replaces the WRAM enable writes with NOPs, and since Mapper 245 always has WRAM enabled in most emulators (a quirk that is not necessary for the one legimitate Mapper 245 game), maybe that's where they got the idea that this must be the correct mapper.
