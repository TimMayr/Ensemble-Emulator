Can this be considered as discrete logic like [iNES Mapper 184](INES_Mapper_184.xhtml "INES Mapper 184")? --[Milowork](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Milowork&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Milowork \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Milowork&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Milowork \(page does not exist\)")) 14:31, 19 June 2021 (MDT) 

    The unusual choice of fixed bank makes it non-obvious. H/V mirroring and UNROM-like PRG banking makes it sort of like [[iNES Mapper 078].3 with its four 74xx ICs, but also makes it like [iNES Mapper 188](INES_Mapper_188.xhtml "INES Mapper 188") which I didn't mark as "discrete logic". So ... I'd say this is one just enough more complicated that I'd probably say no. —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 23:11, 20 June 2021 (MDT)
