Folded version of the NTDEC logo from [bootleggames wiki](http://community.fandom.com/wiki/c:bootleggames:NTDEC "wikia:c:bootleggames:NTDEC"), to represent [mappers](Mapper.xhtml "Mapper") associated with Asder. 

NTDEC started by making pirate multicarts with a CN- prefix. But after being sued by Nintendo in 1991, NTDEC shifted the CN line to original unlicensed games, first under the Mega Soft and Caltron brands, and since 1993 under the name Asder.
