By inspecting a fire emblem cart I'm pretty sure pin 24 is tied to chr pin 24/chr A16. — 68.107.78.15 00:11, 12 November 2014 (MDT) 

    I wonder how INL got a bunk result there? If it's CHR A16 it certainly can't also be PRGRAM /CE. Anyway, the 128KiB games definitely need an A16 pin.
    Any chance you'd be willing to double-check all the other pins? —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 01:45, 12 November 2014 (MST)

    

    I'm guessing he inspected a Famicom Wars cart which only has 64K CHR ROM. I haven't checked all the other pins but nothing else looked out of place. I expect everything else is right.
