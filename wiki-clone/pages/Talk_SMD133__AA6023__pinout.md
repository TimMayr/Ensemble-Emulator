# AA6023 or AA6023B?

Why the name of the page is "AA6023" while it's pinout for AA6023B (regarded to source link)? Anyway, i think that pinout is the same for both since they're using the same PCB. Add redirect from [SMD133 (AA6023B) pinout](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=SMD133_\(AA6023B\)_pinout&action=edit&redlink=1 "SMD133 \(AA6023B\) pinout \(page does not exist\)") page maybe?
