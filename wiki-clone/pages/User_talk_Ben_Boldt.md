Hey Ben. Love all the effort that you are putting into the MMC5. Once you are finished, could you also take a look at the [RAMBO-1](RAMBO_1.xhtml "RAMBO-1")? Its IRQ behavior has mystified many us for quite some time. There was a point when it was thought that we had it all figured out, but then came the _Hard Drivin'_ prototype. I will gladly elaborate once, or if, the time comes.

    Sure, I could have a look at it. I don't currently have a cart with a RAMBO-1 mapper but I will keep an eye out for one. [Ben Boldt](User_Ben_Boldt.xhtml "User:Ben Boldt") (talk) 18:12, 11 January 2019 (MST)

  
It's no substitute for the forum, but at least for now I've been spending time on the "NES Development Discord Server".
