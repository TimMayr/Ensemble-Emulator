## -xROM nomenclature consistency

In some cases, (e.g. [UxROM](UxROM.xhtml "UxROM")), the x is used as a wildcard character. Here, it appears to refer to a specific oversize variant...which has traditionally been an -OROM. So how, then, does one refer to "BNROM and all its variants", if BxROM is taken? [Myask](User_Myask.xhtml "User:Myask") ([talk](User_talk_Myask.xhtml "User talk:Myask")) 15:23, 3 May 2015 (MDT)
