Managed to recover this one so better share it before it's gone. Just some (chubby) astronaut. The sprite size is 16×24 and it takes up 10 tiles for 3 frames of animation. Use first frame for idle, all frames for running (1-2-1-3 order), second frame for jumping/falling. I may make more frames in the future, but these are the base ones I guess. 

Placing this in the public domain if anybody wants to use it.
