**iNES Mapper 171** denotes the 步步高 (Bùbùgāo, BBK) Floppy-1 and SC-98 keyboard famiclones. They are emulated to various degrees by [VirtuaNESex](https://github.com/pengan1987/VirtuaNESex), [VirtuaNES BBK](https://gitee.com/fanoble/emulator-bbk/blob/sb2k/NES/Mapper/MapperBBK.cpp), and a [keyboard-famiclone-specific build of FCEUX](https://github.com/pengan1987/fceux-bbk-yuxing). 

# Notes

  * Mapper 171 had previously been used also for the incompatible Kaiser KS-7058 and the JY043 circuit boards, denoting an MMC1 clone with fixed nametable arrangement and a simplified bootleg variant. They have since been separated to [mapper 1 submapper 7](MMC1.xhtml "MMC1") and [mapper 122](INES_Mapper_122.xhtml "INES Mapper 122"), respectively.
