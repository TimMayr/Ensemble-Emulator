The **ABUSE filter** looks at **a** ctions **b** y **u** sers, **s** uch as **e** dits, runs a few heuristics involving regular expressions, and decides which actions are likely to be unconstructive. It's most useful to limit the damage caused by pattern vandals, or [wiki vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Vandalism") whose edits follow a very distinct [m.o.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modus_operandi "wikipedia:modus operandi") Fortunately, automated vandalism processes are obvious pattern vandals, and a filter administrator can usually discover and curtail the pattern after three edits.
