A **typeface** is a set of glyphs, or images that represent the characters in a script. A **font** is a physical embodiment of a typeface, such as a bitmap font or a scalable outline font.

## Brand fonts

These typefaces have been used in branding for Nintendo products or NES licensees' products. Be careful when using these on a product so as to avoid confusion with the original product's [trade dress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trade_dress "wikipedia:trade dress").

## 8x8-pixel fonts

Most NES games draw text with fonts that occupy some fraction of an 8x8-pixel character cell, such as 6x7 or 7x7 pixels to leave space between glyphs. Many use a font that originated in _[Quiz Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz_Show_\(video_game\) "wikipedia:Quiz Show \(video game\)")_ , a 1976 arcade game published under Atari's Kee Games brand. Vertical strokes are often 2 pixels wide to counteract the NMOS quirk of voltage-dependent output impedance, which widens dark areas by a fraction of a pixel. 

A few games with lowercase have _ligatures,_ or glyphs that represent more than one character. The numerous uses of 'il' in _Thwaite_ are an example, and several ligatures are present in _EarthBound Beginnings_. 

## 8x16-pixel fonts

## Proportional fonts

A **proportional font** or **variable-width font** has glyphs whose advance width differs. This is used, for example, to make 'm' wider than 'i'. 

NES projects using a proportional font: 

  * Tile fonts, with glyph widths as one or more of 8, 16, and 24 
    * The Immortal
    * FizzBuzz
  * [Pino](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples")'s library that renders to CHR RAM 
    * Action 53, RHDE, robotfindskitten, 240p Test Suite, Nova the Squirrel
