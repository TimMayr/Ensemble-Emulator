The X0858CE is a RGB to composite encoder chip used exclusively in the Sharp Famicom Titler (AN-510) and Sharp X1 Turbo III systems. It is currently known to be responsible for taking RGB input, and converting it into composite and S-Video, with adjustments to the colorspace by encoding YIQ, but with a 0.5 gain on the Q channel (`Q = Q * 0.5`). This results in a [noticeably desaturated](PPU_palettes.xhtml#2C05-99 "PPU palettes") output in the process. The chip is also accompanied by a 3.579545 MHz crystal, and a variable capacitor, alongside other components that seem to directly impact/affect the signal the chip outputs. 

The remaining functionality of the chip is not well known, however some investigations have suggested the chip may be responsible for mixing the input video signal for the superimposing feature as well.
