The following is a list of games which utilise the microphone found on the [ Famicom's](Family_Computer.xhtml "Famicom") hard-wired second [ controller](Standard_controller.xhtml "Standard controller"), along with their in-game functionality. The microphone was removed from the New/AV Famicom and NES systems, the latter of which lead to some western localisations having to remove or replace the microphone functionality. Such alterations are also listed when applicable. Emulators may offer an input mapping to the microphone in order to fully support these games. 

## Games

TODO: 

  * Find and add more supported games.
  * Verify the effects, as well as the alterations made in NES releases.

Game  | Effects  | Differences on NES   
---|---|---  
_Zelda no Densetsu: The Hyrule Fantasy (The Legend Of Zelda)_ | Defeats all Pols Voices within a dungeon room, which works on both the FDS disk and Famicom cartridge releases. | Their weakness is altered so they can be defeated using arrows instead. (The manual still states that they are weak to loud noises)   
_Hikari Shinwa: Palutena no Kagami (Kid Icarus)_ | Used along with holding A on controller 2 to attempt to haggle with shopkeepers. | Altered to use controller 2 A+B instead. (A + start/select on the 3D Classics version)   
_Star Soldier_ | Used as part of a cheat code entered on the title screen, and as a requirement for collecting a hidden power-up in stage 3. | Unaltered, so they are inaccessible by normal means.   
_Takeshi no Chousenjou_ | Required by several sections for game completion (E.g. "Singing" karaoke). Pressing controller 2 down+A will allow microphone inputs to be registered with controller 2 A presses instead. |   
_Atlantis no Nazo_ | Activates a microphone power-up which freezes/defeats most enemies. | TODO: Does the Super Pitfall II localisation prototype change this?   
_Family BASIC_ | Can be read in BASIC programs by PEEKing $4016 and ANDing it with 4. V3 also includes a built-in game (GAME 0 - Heart) which uses it. |   
_Star Luster_ | Used along with holding A+B on controller 2 to summon a repair shuttle when at low energy + at least 1 NG status, once per game. |   
_Bungeling Bay (Raid on Bungeling Bay)_ | Lets player 2 summon jets in the two player mode. | Unaltered, so it is inaccessible by normal means.   
_Doraemon_ | Several effects, including defeating enemies on screen and revealing hidden characters. |   
_Apple Town Monogatari: Little Computer People_ | Used with A/B combinations on controller 2 to trigger easter eggs. |   
_Battle Stadium: Senbatsu Pro Yakyuu_ | (After resetting while holding A+B on controller 1) Used so controller 2 can engage a time-out. |   
_Golgo 13 Dai 1 Shou: Kamigami no Tasogare (Golgo 13 - Top Secret Episode)_ | Play a karaoke minigame while paused. | The minigame is disabled. (Use Game Genie codes **XTKATPAV** \+ **XVUEAIAV** to restore it)   
_Hokuto no Ken_ | Used as part of a cheat code to reverse player 2's movement in the two player mode. | Unaltered, so it is inaccessible by normal means.   
_Hanjuku Eiyuu_ | (After a cheat code is enabled) Used to randomise towns. |   
_Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou_ | Required to progress in certain events. |   
_Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 2_ | Same as _Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou_. |   
_Kaiketsu Yancha Maru (Kid Niki: Radical Ninja)_ | Used along with crouching at a statue in 5-8, to access a secret stage. | Unaltered, so it is inaccessible by normal means.   
_Nagagutsu wo Haita Neko: Sekai Isshuu 80 Nichi Dai Bouken (Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure)_ | Same as _Hokuto no Ken_. | Unaltered, so it is inaccessible by normal means. (TODO: verify)   
_Kamen Rider Club: Gekitotsu Shocker Land_ | Used to manipulate the roulette minigame. (TODO: A different Kamen Rider game seems to be conflated with this?) |   
_Kieta Princess_ | Required by a specific character interaction. (TODO: There may be an alternate solution?) |   
_Super Chinese 2: Dragon Kid (Little Ninja Brothers)_ | Required to progress after rescuing a specific character. | The microphone requirement is gone.   
_Bokosuka Wars_ | Used as part of a cheat code (with expansion controllers) to start a game with significantly higher stats. The microphone requirement is extremely strict and relies on the input threshold of the signal detection circuitry (differs between units).[1] |
