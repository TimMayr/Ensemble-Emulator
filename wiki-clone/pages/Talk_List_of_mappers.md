## Redundant

This page is completely redundant with the page [Mapper](Mapper.xhtml "Mapper"). One of them should be deleted and the relevent content which isn't already on the other should be moved. [Bregalad](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bregalad&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Bregalad \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_Bregalad.xhtml "User talk:Bregalad")) 04:40, 5 May 2014 (MDT) 

    Would it be less of a [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself "wikipedia:Don't repeat yourself") violation to make this page an alphabetical index of mappers, as opposed to the iNES-ordered index on [Mapper](Mapper.xhtml "Mapper")? --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 14:53, 5 May 2014 (MDT)
