**MUST**  
**SHOULD**  
**MAY** | The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. (what's this?)

"**RFC 2119: Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels** " is a [RFC memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments "wikipedia:Request for Comments") published by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "wikipedia:Internet Engineering Task Force") that describes the standard meanings of [modal verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb "wikipedia:Modal verb") and some other words used in Internet standards documents. Documents that use RFC 2119 indicate that RFC 2119 applies to a given word by writing the word with all capital letters. 

The most common key words are 

MUST or MUST NOT
    Something is absolutely required.
SHOULD or SHOULD NOT
    Something is strongly recommended.
MAY
    Something is allowable either way.

Not all pages on this wiki need to indicate requirement levels. Pages that are descriptive rather than [prescriptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normative "wikipedia:normative"), that is, those that describe [what is rather than what ought to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-ought_problem "wikipedia:Is-ought problem"), need not use this convention. But pages that do indicate requirement levels SHOULD use this convention and SHOULD use the template `{{[RFC 2119](Template_RFC_2119.xhtml "Template:RFC 2119")}}`, which produces a notice that floats to the right, lest readers confuse these all-capital words with shouting.
