There was a suggestion in [File talk:Cards 32x24 tiles.png](File_talk_Cards_32x24_tiles_png.xhtml "File talk:Cards 32x24 tiles.png") to extend the deck to add Latin suits (swords, cups, coins, and rods), knight (rank between jack and queen), a [joker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_\(playing_card\) "wikipedia:Joker \(playing card\)") (the über-trump in Euchre, a wild card in some poker variants, and a c-c-c-combo breaker in Yomi, whose design corresponding to the Fool in tarot decks), and possibly the rest of the trumps of tarot deck. The Latin suits were the easiest to pixel out. I based the red and black jokers seen here on the jack in [the original deck](File_Cards_32x24_png.xhtml "File:Cards 32x24.png") and added a more elaborate cap and contrasting shoulder attachments. But I'm not sure what to do with the knight (N) or the rest of the trumps.
