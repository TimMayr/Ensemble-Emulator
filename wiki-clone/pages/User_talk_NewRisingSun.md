Hey buddy, I got a copy of Klax for future RAMBO-1 scanline explorations. ;) [Ben Boldt](User_Ben_Boldt.xhtml "User:Ben Boldt") ([talk](User_talk_Ben_Boldt.xhtml "User talk:Ben Boldt")) 20:20, 8 February 2019 (MST) 

## please double-check my edit

I noticed a typo in [NES 2.0 Mapper 337](NES_2_0_Mapper_337.xhtml "NES 2.0 Mapper 337") but I don't know if I corrected it accurately. And it then got lost in Great Hierophant's contributions. Would you double-check?
