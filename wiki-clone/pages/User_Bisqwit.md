My name is Joel Yliluoma. I have been a long-time NES enthusiasist, and my specialty is dealing with NES music. 

In 2003 I also created [TASVideos](http://tasvideos.org/), a website specializing with [tool-assisted speedruns (TAS)](TAS.xhtml "TAS") of classic videogames. Relatedly, I have had hand in the development of a few emulators for different consoles; mostly dealing with adding "rerecording" support, a key feature involved in the creation of TAS videos. 

In December 2011 I [wrote and published an original NES emulator... at YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y71lli8MS8s).
