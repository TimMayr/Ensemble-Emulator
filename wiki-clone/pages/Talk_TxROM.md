On all the board variants tables why do we say things like: 

TFROM | 128, 256, 512 KiB |  | 16, 32, 64 KiB ROM | Supports fixed mirroring   
---|---|---|---|---  
  
AFAIK, TFROM existed only with 128 KiB PRG and 32 or 64 KiB CHR. If the table is for reproductions, why not use a denser format? If it's to document reality, why does it say things that are untrue? Regardless, a legend at the top would be nice. Also, when I made [JxROM](JxROM.xhtml "JxROM"), I assumed this was documentation, not interchangeability guidelines.—[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 16:06, 26 March 2013 (MDT) 

## TGROM / TNROM with CHR ROM?

Is there actually a game with TGROM/TNROM and CHR-ROM? There aren't any listed in bootgod's database that I could find. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 13:30, 4 October 2018 (MDT) 

No, but there's one SNROM game with CHR-ROM, so this shows that Nintendo boards with CHR-RAM can also support CHR-ROM, even though this is rarely used because being limited to only 8k of CHR-ROM is a very strong limitation.[Bregalad](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bregalad&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Bregalad \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_Bregalad.xhtml "User talk:Bregalad")) 00:31, 8 October 2018 (MDT)
