There's a demo by Chris Covell named "Wall". It uses a blue emphasis to simulate the water flooding the wall. ([unsigned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Signatures") post by ~~Zepper~~) 

    Added. I forget whether [flowing_palette](http://blargg.8bitalley.com/parodius/nes-code/flowing_palette.zip) by blargg uses emphasis or not. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 12:25, 23 June 2013 (MDT)

## Dim the screen

Wouldn't it be much better to have all games that "set the colour emphasis to dim the entiere screen" in their own list, rather than repeat the same thing over and over a dozen of times?[Bregalad](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bregalad&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Bregalad \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_Bregalad.xhtml "User talk:Bregalad")) 05:20, 26 May 2015 (MDT) 

    Sure, I agree. This seems uncontroversial, though, probably no need to talk about it first? (Have made the edit.) - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 09:47, 26 May 2015 (MDT)

## Transient Effects

If a game uses colour emphasis just for a few frames in the middle of an effect or for a flash, should it be added on the list or should it be excluded ?

    I think any use is worth mentioning. A lot of the entries already present could use some explanation as to when and how the emphasis bits are used. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 19:02, 23 December 2015 (MST)

    

    I'm pretty sure games where nothing is mentionned always dim the screen (instead of doing it in a particular case)[Bregalad](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bregalad&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Bregalad \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_Bregalad.xhtml "User talk:Bregalad")) 06:56, 28 December 2015 (MST)

## Dragon's Lair

_Dragon's Lair (U) [!]_ has the same problem. [Cluster](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Cluster&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Cluster \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cluster&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Cluster \(page does not exist\)")) 18:36, 20 March 2016 (MDT) 

## Cybernoid

And _Cybernoid - The Fighting Machine (U) [!]_ sets all three bits too. But only in main menu. [Cluster](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Cluster&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Cluster \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cluster&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Cluster \(page does not exist\)")) 20:01, 12 April 2016 (MDT) 

    We should give Cluster permission to edit the wiki rather than having to go via the Talk pages —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 12:45, 15 April 2016 (MDT) 

    After 2 edits 4 days apart, Cluster is autoconfirmed. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 16:39, 15 April 2016 (MDT)
