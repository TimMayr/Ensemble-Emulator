The integral OR gate on pin 26, intended for use with a 28-pin 128KiB CHR-ROM, seems to be too slow. [[1]](https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?p=246719#p246719) To support a 28-pin 128KiB CHR-ROM, some PCBs include an external [7432](7432.xhtml "7432"). 

The associated ADPCM IC is wired as: 
    
    
               µPD7755/6C
                    __  __
    (I4) PRG D6 -> |01\/18| <- PRG D5 (I3)
    (I5) PRG D7 -> |02  17| <- PRG D4 (I2)
       (I6) GND -> |03  16| <- PRG D3 (I1)
       (I7) GND -> |04  15| <- PRG D2 (I0)
    (volume) R2 -> |05  14| <- /START
      sound out <- |06  13| <- /CS (Always connected to GND)
         (BUSY) <- |07  12| <- X1
         /RESET -> |08  11| -> X2
            GND -- |09  10| -- VCC
                   '------'
    

For games that use the ADPCM IC, it's wired as: 
    
    
                    150                (µPD775X.6)
          +5V------/\/\/------+------- AVO

                     1K
          +5V------/\/\/------ REF (µPD775X.7)
    

Most PCBs (JF-24, -25, -29, and -37 without RAM; JF-27 and -40 with RAM and without ADPCM) have jumpers to configure operation: 

  * 0 ohm through-hole jumpers on the component side: 
    * J1 connects CHR ROM /CE = pin 20 of 28 = pin 22 of 32 to PPU A13.
    * J2 connects the same pin to the output of the OR gate.


  * Cut-and-solder jumpers on the solder side: 
    * J3 connects SS 88006 pin 19 to card edge /ROMSEL
    * J4 connects the same pin to the delayed copy of the same signal generated by the 7432.
    * J5 connects SS 88006 pin 1 to card edge M2
    * J6 connects the same pin to the delayed copy of the same signal generated by the 7432.



JF-23 does not have any jumpers; it is always wired as though J2, J3, and J5 were shorted. 

No PCBs have been seen with J4 or J6 enabled, not even on boards that could support it. 

Jaleco's 32-pin CHR ROMs are neither a JEDEC-standard pinout, nor the same as Nintendo's proprietary 32-pin CHR ROMs. Like Nintendo, pin 24 remained A16, and pin 2 became PPU /RD. However, on JF-29, JF-37, and JF-40, A17 is instead on pin 30, and other PCBs don't have a trace for A17 at all.
