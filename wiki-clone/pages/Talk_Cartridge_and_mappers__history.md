## First mapper game

was not Hyper Olympic Gentei Ban. The release date of June 21st 1985 applies to the original Hyper Olympic version, which is NROM. Gentei-ban was released later that year (November 11th 1985, according to [Japanese Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8F%E3%82%A4%E3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%83%94%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF)). That would make "City Connection" from Jaleco the first mapper game, released September 27th 1985.

    It depends on how much hair splitting you want to do for a barely official novelty release. The cited Nov 16th in the article is the supposed availability of the limited edition to the general public. The game itself, according to this page <http://knight2000.sakura.ne.jp/zeninsyugo/rekisi.htm>, was featured on Hachi-ji Da Yo! on Sep 14th. Either way, the June date seems to be in error, as you say. - [Kmg](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Kmg&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Kmg \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kmg&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Kmg \(page does not exist\)")) 08:44, 27 December 2021 (UTC)
