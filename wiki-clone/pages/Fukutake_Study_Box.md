The Study Box is a tape drive/RAM cartridge combination from Fukutake Shoten. Games were loaded off standard stereo audio cassettes. One channel contains game audio, the other encoded game data. 

The [StudyBox file format](StudyBox_file_format.xhtml "StudyBox file format") holds the content of such tapes. Mesen and NintendulatorNRS fully emulate the device.
