PNG representation of an NES palette created with [Bisqwit's palette generator](http://bisqwit.iki.fi/utils/nespalette.php). The exact values used to generate this palette have since been lost, but they come close to this 

  * hue 0
  * saturation 1.2
  * contrast 1.0
  * brightness 1.0
  * gamma 2.2



In any case, this is the palette used by the "savtool" included with my NES graphics editor, and it fairly closely matches the colors I see on my TV except for being significantly desaturated. (On Bisqwit's generator, 2.0 produces more realistic saturation.) 

This is an indexed PNG; the first 64 colors correspond directly to the NES palette. Tinted versions are not included.
