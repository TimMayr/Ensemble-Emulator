The name is Hamtaro126, Known by some as other aliases (SmilyMZX, AtariHacker, ect) 

I hang out in some ROM Hacking communities/forums, I am still doing my best to ROM Hack as much. 

I also seek updates of some system and game specific editors of my choosing once and a while! 

(I usually even keep the the tile editor sections clean) 

I agree to license MY contributions to this wiki towards any licence of my choosing (no licence by default) as of 2017
