## In Russia, Myask pronounces YOU

Would the Cyrillic "Мяск" (m-ya-s-k) also be accurate? --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 10:07, 27 May 2016 (MDT) 

    I haven't studied any Cyrillic languages yet, so I can't answer knowledgeably, but Google Translate's speech module thinks that that is pronounced "meesk"-but "translated" as "myasko". [Myask](User_Myask.xhtml "User:Myask") (talk) 17:57, 27 May 2016 (MDT)
