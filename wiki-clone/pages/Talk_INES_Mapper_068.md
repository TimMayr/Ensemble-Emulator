## Nametables

"Good clarification, but I still find it worth mentioning that the lower and upper nametables always show up in these two respective areas of PPU address space" \- unless you're in 1-screen mirroring mode (which may or may not be supported - my implementation uses a 2-bit mirroring mode for V/H/S0/S1 and Maharaja seems to select S0, though it doesn't seem to do any scrolling). --[Quietust](User_Quietust.xhtml "User:Quietust") 21:59, 27 February 2011 (UTC) 

    I didn't see anything about 1-screen in Disch's doc. If you can show proof of 1-screen capability in the mapper, say by swapping the original cart's PRG ROM with test code, feel free to edit it in. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") 00:14, 28 February 2011 (UTC) 

    The 1-screen part came from [Goroh's document](http://nesdev.org/sunsoft.txt). --[Quietust](User_Quietust.xhtml "User:Quietust") 03:05, 28 February 2011 (UTC)

## License

What does the licensing verification do? --[Zzo38](User_Zzo38.xhtml "User:Zzo38") ([talk](User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml "User talk:Zzo38")) 13:32, 27 January 2013 (MST)
