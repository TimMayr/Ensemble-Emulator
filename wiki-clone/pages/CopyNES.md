**CopyNES** is an add-on board that is installed inside a front-loader NES and connected to a computer via USB or parallel port, depending on the version of the board. The CopyNES allows dumping games, reading and writing saved games, etc. 

The original CopyNES was designed by Kevtris [[1]](http://kevtris.org/Projects/copynes/), and a USB version has long been produced by RetroUSB [[2]](http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?products_id=36).
