## VRC7

Would you post a link to a page where the VRC7 audio disable is mentioned? —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 13:07, 1 October 2013 (MDT) 

    Nevermind, I got someone else to test.—[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 16:49, 2 October 2013 (MDT)

I would not make the page about the VRC7 audio disable because my english is poor. (I'm japanese.) I found it's flag in my investigation with the Famicon, TNS-HFC3, and Cartridge of Lagrange Point when developping sound driver based on MML.
