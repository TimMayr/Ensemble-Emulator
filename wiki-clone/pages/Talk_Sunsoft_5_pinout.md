Pinout by Kevin Horton is wrong, because PPU /A13 connected with CIRAM /CE. 15 pin of FME-7 connected to PPU A13. Please, correct this error. Also, add information that CIRAM A10 directly connected to CHR A10. Thank you. Proof: <http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=3855> P.S. Sorry for my english.

    Your English was fine. I've added the CHR/CIRAM shared output and granted you mainspace editing privileges. Welcome to the wiki. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 09:50, 11 January 2014 (MST)
