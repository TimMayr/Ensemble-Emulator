## "idem" edit summaries

The edit summary for [this edit](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=MMC5&curid=91&diff=10029&oldid=9918) is fine. But the edit summary "idem" for [this](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=INES_Mapper_004&curid=198&diff=10030&oldid=9386), [this](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=INES_Mapper_001&curid=195&diff=10031&oldid=7957), [this](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=INES_Mapper_002&curid=196&diff=10032&oldid=5596), and [this](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=GxROM&curid=126&diff=10033&oldid=9650) confuses future readers of the individual articles' edit histories. Recent Changes isn't the only place where edit summaries are shown; they're also shown in individual articles' edit histories, where they aren't correlated with edits to other pages on the same day. Will other editors be able to tell what "idem" means [here](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=INES_Mapper_004&curid=198&action=history), [here](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=INES_Mapper_001&curid=195&action=history), [here](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=INES_Mapper_002&curid=196&action=history), and [here](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=GxROM&curid=126&action=history)? --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 07:17, 20 April 2015 (MDT) 

    You are correct, I only had recent changes in mind. Unfortunately I don't know how to edit the edit summary of past edit to fix the problem.~~128.179.154.122~~ 07:55, 20 April 2015 (MDT)

    

    A subsequent trivial edit with an edit summary to explain could do it fine, and would be easily read in the page history. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 20:31, 20 April 2015 (MDT)
