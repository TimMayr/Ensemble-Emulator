# INES Mapper 248

From [NESdev Wiki](Nesdev_Wiki.xhtml) | View [current version](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/INES_Mapper_248) | View [other pages](Special_AllPages.xhtml#INES_Mapper_248)

  
Mapper 248 was mistakenly assigned to some Chinese games, for instance, Bao Qing Tian. [iNES Mapper 115](INES_Mapper_115.xhtml "INES Mapper 115"), when implemented correctly, will handle this game, and should render Mapper 248's assignment obsolete. 

It has been proposed in #nesdev that mapper 248 should be reassigned for private use for mappers still in development, such as in emulators and in the [PowerPak](PowerPak.xhtml "PowerPak").
