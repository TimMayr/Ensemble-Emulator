## Point of terminology: "EPROM"

Doesn't it use EEPROMs ? I guess you can't save with an EPROM.Bregalad 20:18, 2 January 2011 (UTC) 

    Technically, "EPROM" literally means erasable programmable ROM. But I guess in some communities, EPROM means UVEPROM (ultraviolet-erasable programmable ROM) in particular. The EPROM on a mapper 16 board is in fact EEPROM, as is the EPROM in some Game Boy Advance Game Paks. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") 02:50, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
