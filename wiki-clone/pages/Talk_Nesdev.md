I will use this page to test my color scheme. If you have any comments about it, write it at the top.[Banshaku](User_Banshaku.xhtml "User:Banshaku") 00:55, 9 November 2009 (UTC) 

  1. I transcluded the main page here instead so we don't have two copies of everything, and can actually talk about Main:Nesdev here
  2. We should fix all the links at [Nesdev](Nesdev.xhtml "Nesdev") to no longer point to parodius
  3. Do we want to have <http://nesdev.org/> redirect to <http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php/Nesdev> ?

    It's been 6 years, I think the colour scheme has been tested enough by now. Removed the transclusion and CSS. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 19:17, 25 March 2016 (MDT)
