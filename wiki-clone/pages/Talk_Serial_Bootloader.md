## Comparison

It's interesting to see how you came to different solutions for the same issues that I found when trying to design a cart with no Flash/EPROMs. Well, technically possibly a USB or SD-card slot containing a Flash drive. Thanks for sharing this project with us! I'll be sure to return the favor once I'm able to prototype my card and buy the system to test it. I can't wait for when you're ready to start discussing the design. :) [alphamule](User_Alphamule.xhtml "User:Alphamule") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alphamule&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Alphamule \(page does not exist\)")) 07:51, 30 August 2014 (MDT)
