## Edit request

In the "Compilers" section, the word "NesDev" was misspelled as "NedDev". Could someone fix it? --[LucianoTheWindowsFan](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:LucianoTheWindowsFan&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:LucianoTheWindowsFan \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LucianoTheWindowsFan&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:LucianoTheWindowsFan \(page does not exist\)")) 15:20, 31 March 2021 (MDT)
