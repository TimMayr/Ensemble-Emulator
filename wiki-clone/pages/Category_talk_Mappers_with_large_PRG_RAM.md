Suggest move to "Category:Mappers with bankable PRG RAM" (bank-switchable? Exact word choice uncertain...) but 'large' is vague and the page clearly specifies that it means bank-switchable.

    If you want to make it not vague, I'd actually suggest to define it in the category that anything over 8k is "large". That's a pretty meaningful boundary in terms of NES PRG-RAM. Banking isn't necessarily the qualification (should the FDS RAM adapter be in this category?) - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 17:16, 21 April 2015 (MDT)

    

    My point is more that the name of the category itself is vague. The description given on the page is perfectly serviceable. This feels more like it's telling me that such-and-such mappers have Huge Guts. [Myask](User_Myask.xhtml "User:Myask") ([talk](User_talk_Myask.xhtml "User talk:Myask")) 18:38, 21 April 2015 (MDT)
