It's a surprise for me to see the article about my own homebrew mapper. Who and how assigned the mapper number for it?

    NewRisingSun did so, as part of his "allocate mappers for everything in UNIF" and "generate an authoritative set of headers for NES2.0" —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 00:48, 30 July 2021 (UTC) 

    Everybody can create his own mapper. I don't think that every mapper should have a number. Especially when there are no emulators (official builds) that emulate it. And especially when this mapper is still under development.

    I would be pretty honored to be responsible for a new mapper number myself. Is there a particular reason that you didn't want this to happen? Do you intend to prevent others from using it or patent it or something? I guess I am a little jealous. Help me understand where you are coming from on this.

    I don't mind assigning a number to my mapper. On the contrary, it is an honor for me. It just surprised me, and I think out loud.
