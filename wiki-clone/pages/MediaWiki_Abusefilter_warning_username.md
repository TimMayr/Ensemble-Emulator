**Welcome to NESdev.**

Certain username patterns have been used in the past by automated processes to [deface wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Vandalism"). This wiki restricts registration of usernames that resemble these.

A brief description of the [ABUSE](Nesdev_wiki_ABUSE_filter.xhtml "Nesdev wiki:ABUSE filter") rule which your action matched is: $1
