What is even the point of this page? It is an awful mix of a description of a document and an errata of the said document, that is not understandable if you don't have the document below the eyes. I'd say if you want to do errata it belongs to the [errata] page, or much better, @Koitsu, update your document to release a new version that fixes the current inaccuracies (it's never too late, and for historical reason, I belive your doccument is great, *much* better than this wiki). 

Describing the document in the wiki could make sense, but then it would make more sense to describe many document in one page, or else the number of page dedicated to document descriptions will grow very large.
