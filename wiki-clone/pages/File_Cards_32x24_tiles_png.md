A set of 128 tiles from which 32x24 pixel playing cards can be built, for the [placeholder graphics](Placeholder_graphics.xhtml "Placeholder graphics") collection. Use these to make your own NES game, with blackjack and hookers. (See [File:Cards 32x24.png](File_Cards_32x24_png.xhtml "File:Cards 32x24.png") for how the assembled cards look.) 

This is for the poker deck, including a black joker. It is missing several cards from the tarot deck, such as the other 21 trumps, and the rank "C" or "N" that represents Jack's older brother. Those would cause the set to exceed 128 tiles.
