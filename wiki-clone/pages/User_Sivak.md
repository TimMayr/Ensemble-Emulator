My alias is Sivak and I've done some work on the NES. Here's a list of things I have done: 

## Commercial projects

These are listed chronologically. 

  * **[Geminim](User_Sivak_2_in_1_Geminim_Siamond.xhtml "User:Sivak/2-in-1 Geminim/Siamond")** \- Based on the logic game of [Nim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim).
  * **[Siamond](User_Sivak_2_in_1_Geminim_Siamond.xhtml "User:Sivak/2-in-1 Geminim/Siamond")** \- Based on [Simon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%28game%29), the pattern repetition game. 
    * _The aforementioned games were released together on a[multicart](User_Sivak_2_in_1_Geminim_Siamond.xhtml "User:Sivak/2-in-1 Geminim/Siamond")._

## Other projects

  * NES Palette tester - A simple program that loads in the various shades of colors on the NES. Included as an easter egg in the [2-in-1 Geminim/Siamond](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=2-in-1_Geminim/Siamond&action=edit&redlink=1 "2-in-1 Geminim/Siamond \(page does not exist\)") cart.
  * Falldown - It was an entry for the 2008 minigame competition. It won third place. I might make a more refined version of it sometime and bundle it into another multicart.
