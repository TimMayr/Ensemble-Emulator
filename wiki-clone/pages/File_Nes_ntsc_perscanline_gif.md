A testcard picture, intentionally resembling Philips PM5544, but rendered with NES colors. 

Rendered in 2048x240, then pixel-upscaled to 2048x1920, then lanczos-downscaled to 584x480. This method of scaling was chosen to best inhibit scaling related artifacts. 

This image is part of a set illustrating the differences between palette-and-pixel-based and scanline-and-ntsc-signal-based rendering in NES emulation. This image shows the scanline-and-ntsc-signal-based rendering. 

Note that the colors are not perfectly reproduced from the original rendering, due to GIF palette reduction. A NeuQuant-based method was used in order to generate the most optimal palette to represent it.
