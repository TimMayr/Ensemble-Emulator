## Access levels

User access levels on this wiki roughly mirror [those of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_access_levels "wikipedia:Wikipedia:User access levels"), except for slightly tighter restrictions on editing pages that are not talk pages. 

Visitors who have not registered are called "IPs" or "anons", after the [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "wikipedia:IP address") that appears next to contributions. 

  * An **IP** can view any page and edit any talk page.



Creating an account is easy. 

  * A registered **user** can ~~configure his view of the wiki~~ and edit talk pages without revealing his IP address to the public. To become a registered user, [join the wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup). If you have trouble answering the trivia question, contact ~~an administrator~~ through his user talk page or through the [BBS](https://forums.nesdev.org/).



Most registered users can easily join the emailconfirmed and autoconfirmed groups, which grant basic ~~privileges~~ : 

  * An **emailconfirmed** user can edit pages outside talk namespaces, send e-mail to other emailconfirmed users, and add external links without having to solve a CAPTCHA every time. To become emailconfirmed, check your e-mail inbox for a message that the wiki sends after you register, and follow the instructions. At times, this mechanism may be broken; report it as such in [Wiki issues](https://forums.nesdev.org/viewforum.php?f=16).
  * A user who is **trusted** can edit pages outside talk namespaces, move pages, and upload images and other media. You become **autoconfirmed** (automatically trusted) once you make make two edits while logged in and wait four days after you have registered. If you are not already emailconfirmed, these two edits have to be in talk pages. But if your initial talk page edits show knowledge, or you verify your identity through the BBS or [IRC](NESdev_IRC_channel.xhtml "IRC") channel, an administrator may grant you trusted rights immediately.



If you become a regular, you can ask an administrator for extra privileges: 

  * A **rollbacker** can quickly [revert changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Reverting "wikipedia:Help:Reverting") to a page [without having to confirm the action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Rollback "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Rollback"). It's useful for undoing [obviously unconstructive edits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Vandalism"). All administrators have this tool, as do ~~these users~~.



Some groups are available only by invitation ([don't call us; we'll call you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_principle "wikipedia:Hollywood principle")): 

  * An **administrator** , or **sysop** , can perform sensitive actions: delete pages, view and restore deleted pages, protect and unprotect pages, edit [protected pages](Nesdev_wiki_Protection.xhtml "Nesdev wiki:Protection"), make a user trusted, strip away users' editing privileges ("block") and restore them ("unblock"), edit ~~user interface messages~~ , and configure the [ABUSE filter](Nesdev_wiki_ABUSE_filter.xhtml "Nesdev wiki:ABUSE filter"). See the ~~list of administrators~~.
  * A **bureaucrat** can promote users to administrator and rename users. See the ~~list of bureaucrats~~.



To request the attention of an administrator to perform a sensitive action on a page, use the `{{[sudo](Template_Sudo.xhtml "Template:Sudo")}}` template on the talk page. 

## Blocking

Users whose first edit is [blatant spam](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=Metawikipedia:Wiki_spam&action=edit&redlink=1 "Metawikipedia:Wiki spam \(page does not exist\)") or a wall of non-English text will be blocked on sight. If you have trouble with English, go ahead and use a free online machine translation tool; we won't [bite you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BITE "wikipedia:WP:BITE") for grammar mistakes. Usernames that indicate intent to do something unconstructive, such as intent to "review" (euphemism for advertise) a specific product, will be indefinitely blocked on sight. So will unpronounceable gibberish usernames that appear to have been registered by a bot. Administrators may use judgment as to whether to block the IP address used to create the account. Blocks can be appealed on the blocked user's talk page unless the blocked user has abused the appeal process.
