MAP066: Here in my notes, bit #7 of the value written controls mirroring: 

0: vertical mirroring 1: horizontal mirroring 

Could someone confirm it, please? --[Zepper](User_Zepper.xhtml "User:Zepper") 19:47, 16 June 2012 (PDT) 

    I looked at a photo of the front of [Gumshoe](http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=725) and there are very clear V (vertical arrangement) and H (horizontal arrangement) pads. Mirroring is fixed. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") 06:05, 17 June 2012 (PDT)
