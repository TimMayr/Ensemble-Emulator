## MC Kids?

Dwedit added MC Kids to the list of games that change palette mid frame but I couldn't find any evidence of it doing this. It does seem to disable rendering early near the bottom of the screen, but I didn't manage to catch any mid-screen palette changes, at least not in the introduction or first level. Does it really have one somewhere? - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 17:38, 8 December 2017 (MST)
