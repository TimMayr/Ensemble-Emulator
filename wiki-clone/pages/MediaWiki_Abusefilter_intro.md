Welcome to the ABUSE filter management interface. The [ABUSE filter](Nesdev_wiki_ABUSE_filter.xhtml "Nesdev wiki:ABUSE filter") is an automated software mechanism of applying automatic heuristics to all **a** ctions **b** y **u** sers, **s** uch as **e** dits (hence the name). This interface shows a list of defined filters, and allows site administrators to modify them. To propose new filters or report false positives (constructive edits identified as unconstructive), see [Nesdev wiki talk:ABUSE filter](Nesdev_wiki_talk_ABUSE_filter.xhtml "Nesdev wiki talk:ABUSE filter").
