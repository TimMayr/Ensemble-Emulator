If your intent is to transfer the contents of the old wiki to this one, it would be much simpler to [Export](http://nesdevwiki.org/wiki/Special:Export) all of the pages from the old wiki (revision histories included) to an XML file, then ~~Import~~ it here. --[Quietust](User_Quietust.xhtml "User:Quietust") 15:47, 11 June 2009 (UTC) 

  
Ho... I was not aware of this option. Thanks for the comment. I have imported by hand the most common page already so I don't know how much it would clash if I do an import now. hmm.. How much value is the history of the old one, this is more the question now. 

  * You may find [this page](http://nesdevwiki.org/wiki/Special:Allpages) to be of significant convenience. Especially take note of the "Namespace" dropdown. --[Quietust](User_Quietust.xhtml "User:Quietust") 03:54, 13 June 2009 (UTC)



  
Thanks for the comment. I have been checking all the special page one by one yesterday to see which one were relevant. Now I will just use the export option for the few pages left. They are mostly pages that will be re-located in the "getting started" section (tutorial etc). I don't know much about wiki editing so I still have a lot to learn but hey, at least we have content now :) 

By the way, your emulator is great. Continue the good work. If you could add shortcuts for the key in the debugging mode like visual studio, that would be quite useful! --[Banshaku](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bankshaku&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Bankshaku \(page does not exist\)") 04:07, 13 June 2009 (UTC) 

## User CSS

I'm away from the computer with ndwiki's password. Can someone turn on user CSS in LocalSettings.php so that I can test site styles before I su to deploy them? If not, I will in a few hours. 
    
    
    $wgAllowUserCss = true;

    Done. It took me a while to get used to koitsu's FreeBSD installation: it lacks nano, and its vim lacks the insert-mode key bindings that another popular Free operating system has. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") 21:16, 2 April 2010 (UTC)
