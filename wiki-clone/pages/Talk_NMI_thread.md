I think this article is extremely confusing. 

Instead of being just plain examples, it should instead consider the 3 techniques of : \- Everything in main \- Everything in NMI \- Work split between NMI thread and main thread 

And explain the pros and cons of each techniques. 

The example of the scrolling playfield and fixed status bar is a great example, but again the article is very confusing Bregalad 13:14, 27 April 2012 (PDT)
