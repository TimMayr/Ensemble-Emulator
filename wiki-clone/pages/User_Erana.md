## NES

### NES Lisp

I programmed neslisp which can be found at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/neslisp/> I also ported it to the Commodore 64, here's the link : <http://sourceforge.net/projects/neslispc64/> The C64 version was made with cc65 (<http://www.cc65.org>) and can be easily ported to the NES natively but has memory area overflows.

### ADOS-NES

There's also ados-nes at <http://sf.net/projects/ados-os-nes> which is my OS ported to the NES with lots of useful features for hardware hacking, the "massive" x86 ados OS is at <http://sf.net/projects/ados-os>

See: [ADOS NES](User_Erana_ADOS_NES.xhtml "User:Erana/ADOS NES")

### bmp2nesc

bmp2nesc is a BMP to NES image, file converter. It is available with source code [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bmp2nesc). 

## GBA

### Arm Lisp

arm-lisp is a Lisp compiler written in Objective-C (GNUstep) to provide for a good language on the ARMv7. It has a project page on <https://sf.net/projects/arm-lisp>

## Misc Games

### Super Mario Brothers (brothersinarms)

Then for fun, I made a Super Mario Bros. codebase with 2 levels, it has a windows version and was made with Python and Pygame (<http://pygame.org>). Here it is : <http://sourceforge.net/projects/brothersinarms/>

### Zelda II : The adventure of Link (pyZeldaII)

pyZelda II was also written by me and is a Python and Pygame based game which includes a full engine for making Zelda II games and has free source code written in Java at : <http://github.com/zork9/pygame-pyZeldaII>

### 1943

A '1943 : The battle of Midway' clone was my first game programmed on Linux : <https://forty-two.sourceforge.net/> The AI of enemies can be scripted in scheme with guile 1.6.
