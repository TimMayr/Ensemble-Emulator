MAPR **900218** describes the PCB used for the pirate port _Lord of King_ or _Axe of Fight_ (the pirates evidently hadn't decided), a mapper hack of _Astynax_. 

This has been allocated [NES 2.0 Mapper 524](NES_2_0_Mapper_524.xhtml "NES 2.0 Mapper 524"). 

It has been modified to use a [VRC2](VRC2_and_VRC4.xhtml "VRC2"), with registers placed compatible with the [VRC4e](VRC2_and_VRC4.xhtml "VRC4") variant (i.e. registers from $8000-$9004 and $A000-$E00C are thus identical to [VRC4e](VRC2_and_VRC4.xhtml "VRC4"). ) The register mask is $F00C. 

Additionally, a simple fixed-period IRQ (of 1024 M2 cycles) is mapped to $F008 and $F00C: 

  * Writes to $F00C (and mirrors) acknowledge an IRQ, reset the timer to 0, and prevent counting
  * Writes to $F008 (and mirrors) allow the counter to start



The counter's 1024s bit is inverted into the Famicom's /IRQ line; i.e. if the IRQ is ignored for 1024 cycles it will self-acknowledge.
