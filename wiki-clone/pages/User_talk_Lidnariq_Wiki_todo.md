## 32x32

    I did a quick pass over these, just using nearest-neighbour. I think it's important to optimize for 16x16 rather than 32x32. (These will still look well at 32x32 this way.) Moved my commentary on this to [Mapper talk page](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mapper&diff=11215&oldid=11200). - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 22:21, 12 June 2015 (MDT) 

    Makes sense. JY Company was originally higher-resolution though, so I'll redo that ... as soon as I figure out how to, anyway. —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 22:51, 12 June 2015 (MDT)
