Are the SOUND and IRQ pins inputs or outputs? --[Zzo38](User_Zzo38.xhtml "User:Zzo38") ([talk](User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml "User talk:Zzo38")) 13:49, 11 March 2013 (MDT) 

    IRQ is the same open-collector shared line throughout.
    SOUND is the audio after it's buffered, but before the expansion audio is mixed in.
    I'll incorporate this into the page. —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 13:57, 11 March 2013 (MDT)
