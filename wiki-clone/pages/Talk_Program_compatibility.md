## Passive-aggressive

How is this any more passive-aggressive than [Game bugs](Game_bugs.xhtml "Game bugs")? --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 18:16, 28 July 2015 (MDT) 

    It's passive-aggressive because you have a direct way of dealing with the problem that raydempsey had a bug in his _in-development game_. I think it's quite rude to put it on a list like this given the situation. He's still working on it! Your edit said "[namin' and shamin'](http://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=Program_compatibility&diff=11335&oldid=9718)", I presume as a joke, but I think it's an accurate description of what it was effectively doing. This is completely different than enumerating bugs in long-dead software by people who are not members of this community.

    Yes, you did let him know directly on the board. That part was good. In light of this your actions weren't passive-aggressive as a whole. I was really just referring to the act of putting up a public notice about someone's bug, which by itself is a rather rude and passive-aggressive way of telling them to fix their software.

    The other entries on the list are probably fine/useful. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 21:21, 28 July 2015 (MDT)

## Compatible and Incompatible

I'm not sure I understand the utility of the three categories. I think the approach taken by [Game bugs](Game_bugs.xhtml "Game bugs") is better. We should just be listing bugs in homebrew games, possibly with categorization by the nature of the bug. 

The compatible category seems pointlessly incomplete. There is a great deal of homebrews software that should be considered "compatible". I would also suggests that all software has bugs; we just haven't found bugs in these ones yet. ;P I get that the word "compatible" is supposed to refer to emulators vs. hardware, but that's a moving target. Every emulator is different. 

What does "incompatible programs" mean? Crash on boot? I'm sure each of these games has a different reason for failing to run. It's mildly useful to have a list of software that shouldn't be expected to run on a good emulator, but this form is rather poor information. 

On a related note, does anyone else get occasional black squares in the world background when running the Super Bat Puncher demo on their PowerPak? I've always thought it had a bug, but I never tracked down what it was. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 21:33, 28 July 2015 (MDT) 

    I investigated the four listed games, and have revised the structure of the page like I suggested. I think we should just put any homebrew bugs here, not just emulator compatibility issues, though obviously the compatibility is a big problem for homebrew in a way that it (mostly) wasn't for commercial-era games, so I've tried to make that prominently explained at the top. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 22:33, 28 July 2015 (MDT)

## Homebrew list in poor taste / disrespectful?

I've [removed the list of bugs in old homebrew](https://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=Program_compatibility&diff=14266&oldid=13303), because I feel it's a bit disrespectful. It's bothered me a long time, and it seems to single out a few very specific bugs/people. Even though the pretense is that these are cautionary examples for programmers and/or useful for keeping an emulator author from attempting to "fix" a broken ROM with emulation, but in practice I don't think it serves either function well, and I think the attempt comes at a detrimental cost to the community. I think if there is something to be learned from the examples we should find a better way to express those examples, and really I think we are covering the actual emulation/programming issues pretty well elsewhere in the Wiki and the Forum-- we don't need to shame a random selection of community contributors for having 20 year old bugs in their games to accomplish this. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 18:46, 21 October 2017 (MDT)
