32x24 pixel playing cards for the [placeholder graphics](Placeholder_graphics.xhtml "Placeholder graphics") collection: poker deck plus black and red jokers. Pixel limits produce "jumbo index" rank and suit symbols, generic pips, and very simplified face cards representing a boy (J), mother (Q), and father (K). The 6 of each suit uses the Latin symbols for the suits (swords, cups, coins, rods) instead of the French symbols (spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs). (See [File:Cards 32x24 tiles.png](File_Cards_32x24_tiles_png.xhtml "File:Cards 32x24 tiles.png") for the tiles rearranged to fit in a 2 KiB CHR bank, except the red joker and Latin suits.)
