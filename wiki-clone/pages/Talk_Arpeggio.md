## Non-looped

You mention "non-looped arpeggio"; also ppMCK can do this, although "non-looped arpeggio" is just a specific case of this. Is this of any mention (since it also allows to make a delayed arpeggio, or one kind at first and then loops another one, etc)? --[Zzo38](User_Zzo38.xhtml "User:Zzo38") ([talk](User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml "User talk:Zzo38")) 22:05, 18 August 2013 (MDT)
