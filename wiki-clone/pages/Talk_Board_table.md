## Rarity Legend

Does a rarity of A+ mean "really rare" or "really easy to find?" A legend would be useful. --jeffythedragonslayer 6:58 PM EST Jan 12, 2023 

## Old and outdated

Man I can't belive this old and outdated table has been copied to this wiki. Shouldn't a link to the complete and recently updated Bootgod's database be better ?!?Bregalad 18:35, 8 June 2011 (UTC) 

    This page can be downloaded as HTML and searched offline with Ctrl+F in a web browser. What tool do you recommend for displaying and searching the [NesCartDB XML](http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/xml.php) offline? I _could_ make a short Python program that updates this table from the XML; would that be better? --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") 19:22, 8 June 2011 (UTC)

You got a point. Although even better, the table could be downloaded in txt. I always throught it could be amazing to have the board list when going to a garage sale and you see games you don't remember which board they use (to use them for donnor cart). Now that I have a powerpak, I don't need devcarts anymore though so this is no problem anymore for me, therefore I didn't think about the offline thing. Your tool in Python sounds good but shouldn't it be a bit hard to do ? Well if you feel like it I'm not preventing anyone from doing it.Bregalad 19:50, 8 June 2011 (UTC) 

    The Python program wouldn't be too hard. It would go essentially like this: load the XML from NesCartDB, load the existing rarity value for each title (NesCartDB doesn't track these), and then for each title that was released in the NTSC NES region, spit out the mapper number and board name in wiki table format that I can paste here. I might work on it after I finish my current project, which is related to the NESdev compo hosted by NA. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") 01:36, 9 June 2011 (UTC)
