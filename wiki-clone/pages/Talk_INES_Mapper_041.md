## Box drawing characters

On my computer, the box drawing characters are not present in the monospaced font used for this site's preformatted text boxes. This means the line drawing characters have to be substituted from another font. This other font's box drawing characters are slightly wider than the ordinary monospaced font's space character, causing things to be out of alignment by a small amount. But then it could just be the choice of font in [my customized CSS](User_Tepples_monobook_css.xhtml "User:Tepples/monobook.css"), as I hadn't seen anyone try to use the box drawing characters on this wiki before now. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") 03:56, 17 July 2012 (PDT)
