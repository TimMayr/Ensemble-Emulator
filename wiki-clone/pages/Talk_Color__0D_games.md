## Videos of what goes wrong with use of color $0D

NewRisingSun, you're going to have to explain why it's not useful to have these failure modes linked to demonstrations. "Because The Immortal uses emphasis _and also_ color $0D" doesn't cut it. —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 18:00, 17 July 2023 (UTC) 

    Because "The Immortal" uses color $0D for a different purpose than all other games, and yes, because it uses deemphasis together with color $0D. That last reason absolutely does cut it, since emphasis applies to color $0D, making it even darker than normal, and so produces effects that color $0D alone would not produce.

    So your argument is that because the The Immortal is the worst case, it's not useful to link to videos of how that goes wrong. I'm going to have to disagree. —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 19:48, 17 July 2023 (UTC) 

    No, my argument is that the videos don't show what the section heading and the description say they are showing. The description says "when using $0D", not "when using $0D plus emphasis". Videos should illustrate what the text says, not something else that is only related to what the text says.
    If you want the video links to have a place in that section, the description needs to change to apply to what the videos actually show. For example, one could remove the video links in the enumeration of possible effects of $0D alone, then add a paragraph stating that all of these effects are potentially worse or likelier when using $0D together with emphasis, and _then_ link the videos. But not as it is now. (And even then, "$0D appears the same black as the other black colors" does not need to be illustrated with a video at all.) —[NewRisingSun](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:NewRisingSun&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:NewRisingSun \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_NewRisingSun.xhtml "User talk:NewRisingSun")) 19:58, 17 July 2023 (UTC)
