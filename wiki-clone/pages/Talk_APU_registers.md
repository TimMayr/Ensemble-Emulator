\- Perhaps not only labels for PPU registers, but APU regs too? I'm liking the idea. ^_^;; 

$4015 as APUSTATUS, $4017 as APUMODE, $4000 as APUxxxVOL, $4001 as APUxxxSWP, $4002 as APUxxxLOW, $4003 as APUxxxHIGH. 

xxx = SQ1 or SQ2 (squares), TRI (triangle), NOI (noise), DMC and so on... What do you think about it? --[Zepper](User_Zepper.xhtml "User:Zepper") 15:21, 3 March 2010 (UTC) 

Well obviously I don't like the idea and I oppose it for reasons I've already said. It's my opinion tough.Bregalad 15:49, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

Well, yes. --[Zepper](User_Zepper.xhtml "User:Zepper") 21:40, 4 March 2010 (UTC) 

This page would be greatly improved if the registers were in a 2D table, where one dimension represent the sound channel (Square 1, Square 2, Triangle, Noise) and the other dimension the register (control, sweep, Freq low and freq high). ~~178.196.50.120~~ 11:11, 21 August 2016 (MDT)
