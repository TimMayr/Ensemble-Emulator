**iNES Mapper 186** was originally assigned for the BIOS of the [Fukutake Study Box](Fukutake_Study_Box.xhtml "Fukutake Study Box"). The only emulators that emulate this device, Mesen and NintendulatorNRS, both require the BIOS image as a headerless .BIN file however, making this mapper assignment useless.
