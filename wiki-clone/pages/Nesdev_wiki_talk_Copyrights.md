## Nothing?

We might want some manner of page here, unless it's thought that the "Please note that all contributions to Nesdev wiki may be edited, altered, or removed by other contributors. If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly, then do not submit it here." blurb is enough.[Myask](User_Myask.xhtml "User:Myask") ([talk](User_talk_Myask.xhtml "User talk:Myask")) 18:09, 10 June 2015 (MDT) 

    Why would anyone know to look at [Nesdev wiki:Copyrights](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=Nesdev_wiki:Copyrights&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nesdev wiki:Copyrights \(page does not exist\)")? What "blurb" are you quoting? - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 23:21, 10 June 2015 (MDT)

    Oh, I see. It's linked in the edit box boilerplate. What controls that? Hmm. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 23:21, 10 June 2015 (MDT)

    

    Seems to be [MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning](MediaWiki_Copyrightwarning.xhtml "MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning") or [MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning2](MediaWiki_Copyrightwarning2.xhtml "MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning2"), for future reference. They appear to be the text that comes with MediaWiki? - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 23:26, 10 June 2015 (MDT)
