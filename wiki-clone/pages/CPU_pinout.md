### Signal description

Active-Low signals are indicated by a "/". Every cycle is either a read or a write cycle. 

  * **CLK** : 21.47727 MHz (NTSC) or 26.6017 MHz (PAL) clock input. Internally, this clock is divided by 12 (NTSC [2A03](CPU.xhtml "CPU")) or 16 (PAL [2A07](CPU.xhtml "CPU")) to feed the 6502's clock input φ0, which is in turn inverted to form φ1, which is then inverted to form φ2. φ1 is high during the first phase (half-cycle) of each CPU cycle, while φ2 is high during the second phase.
  * **AD1** : Audio out pin (both pulse waves).
  * **AD2** : Audio out pin (triangle, noise, and DPCM).
  * **Axx** and **Dx** : Address and data bus, respectively. **Axx** holds the target address during the entire read/write cycle. For reads, the value is read from **Dx** during φ2. For writes, the value appears on **Dx** during φ2 (and no sooner).
  * **OUT0..OUT2** : Output pins used by the controllers ($4016 output latch bits 0-2). These 3 pins are connected to either the [NES](Expansion_port.xhtml "NES expansion port pinout") or [Famicom's](Expansion_port.xhtml "Famicom expansion port pinout") expansion port, and **OUT0** is additionally used as the "strobe" signal (OUT) on both [controller ports](Controller_port_pinout.xhtml "Controller port pinout").
  * **/OE1** and **/OE2** : Controller ports (for controller #1 and #2 respectively). Each enable the output of their respective controller, if present.
  * **R/W** : Read/write signal, which is used to indicate operations of the same names. Low is write. **R/W** stays high/low during the entire read/write cycle.
  * **/NMI** : Non-maskable interrupt pin. See the 6502 manual and [CPU interrupts](CPU_interrupts.xhtml "CPU interrupts") for more details.
  * **/IRQ** : Interrupt pin. See the 6502 manual and [CPU interrupts](CPU_interrupts.xhtml "CPU interrupts") for more details.
  * **M2** : Can be considered as a "signals ready" pin. It is a modified version the 6502's φ2 (which roughly corresponds to the CPU input clock φ0) that allows for slower ROMs. CPU cycles begin at the point where **M2** goes low. 
    * In the NTSC 2A03E, G, and H, **M2** has a [duty cycle](Glossary.xhtml "Glossary") of 15/24 (5/8), or 350ns/559ns. Equivalently, a CPU read (which happens during the second, high phase of **M2**) takes 1 and 7/8th PPU cycles. The internal φ2 duty cycle is exactly 1/2 (one half).
    * In the PAL 2A07, **M2** has a duty cycle of 19/32, or 357ns/601ns, or 1.9 out of 3.2 pixels.
    * In the original NTSC 2A03 (no letter), M2 has a duty cycle of 17/24, or 396ns/559ns, or 2 and 1/8th pixels.
  * **[TST](CPU_Test_Mode.xhtml "CPU Test Mode")** : (tentative name) Pin 30 is special: normally it is grounded in the NES, Famicom, PC10/VS. NES and other Nintendo Arcade Boards (Punch-Out!! and Donkey Kong 3). But if it is pulled high on the RP2A03G, extra diagnostic registers to test the sound hardware are enabled from $4018 through $401A, and the joystick ports $4016 and $4017 become open bus. On the RP2A07 (and presumably also the RP2A03E), pulling pin 30 high instead causes the CPU to stop execution by means of activating the embedded 6502's RDY input.
  * **/RST** : When low, holds CPU in reset state, during which all CPU pins (except pin 2) are in high impedance state. When released, CPU starts executing code (read $FFFC, read $FFFD, ...) after 6 M2 clocks.
