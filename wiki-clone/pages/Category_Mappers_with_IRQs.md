Many boards have the ability to tell the CPU that it's time to do something specific. See [IRQ](IRQ.xhtml "IRQ"). 

  * [Category:Mappers with fixed-timing IRQs](Category_Mappers_with_fixed_timing_IRQs.xhtml "Category:Mappers with fixed-timing IRQs") \- IRQs that do not have a configurable timing interval.
  * [Category:Mappers with cycle IRQs](Category_Mappers_with_cycle_IRQs.xhtml "Category:Mappers with cycle IRQs") \- IRQs that operate by counting CPU cycles.
  * [Category:Mappers with scanline IRQs](Category_Mappers_with_scanline_IRQs.xhtml "Category:Mappers with scanline IRQs") \- IRQs that operate in response to the PPU for scanline-based timing.
