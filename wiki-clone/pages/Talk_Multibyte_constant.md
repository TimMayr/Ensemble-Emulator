Maybe just put both versions on some sort of page like [Multibyte constant code](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=Multibyte_constant_code&action=edit&redlink=1 "Multibyte constant code \(page does not exist\)") and find a place to link to them from. Is there a "programming techniques" page? - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 21:30, 29 June 2015 (MDT) 

    You are correct; perhaps it ought to be. I don't know if "programming techniques" page exists though; if not should it be made up? But, maybe a category might help. --[Zzo38](User_Zzo38.xhtml "User:Zzo38") ([talk](User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml "User talk:Zzo38")) 22:42, 29 June 2015 (MDT)

    

    I think [Programming guide](Programming_guide.xhtml "Programming guide") currently has a bunch of links to snippets of code like this. It could go there. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 10:29, 30 June 2015 (MDT) 

    Consider it done. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 18:56, 30 June 2015 (MDT)
