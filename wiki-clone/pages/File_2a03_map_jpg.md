A rough diagram of where everything is physically located on the RP2A03G. The clock divider, not highlighted, is at the far right. 

The large section at the upper right appears to be a test pattern, used for measuring the characteristics of transistors of various lengths, widths, and types (enhancement versus [depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depletion-load_NMOS_logic "wikipedia:Depletion-load NMOS logic")). 

The sections marked "Square0/Square1/Noise Position", upon closer investigation, are actually the Envelope counters. 

  
Detailed images of each layer of the die can be found [here](https://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/chipimages/#rp2a03), including a more detailed version of this image as an overlay - these can potentially be used to build a netlist of everything but the 6502.
