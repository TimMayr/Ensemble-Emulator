The only mapper 166 ROM file I found on-line was the Russian СЮБОР ОБУЧАЮЩИЙ КОМПЬЮТЕР software ("Subor V1.0 (R).nes"). "Consolethinks" just redumped it using mode 0 and going through all 16 KiB banks from 0 upwards, and the resulting ROM image works as mapper 167, nor 166. I suspect that mapper 166 is a bad mapper designed to accomodate a ROM dump that has its banks mixed up.
