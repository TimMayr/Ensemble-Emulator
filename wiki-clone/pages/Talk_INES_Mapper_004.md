## Obsolete mutual exclusion

From Disch's notes: "when homebrewing: choose either 4-screen or WRAM. You can't have both"

Certainly a board could be constructed that had MMC3, PRG RAM at $6000-$7FFF, and extra nametable RAM at $2800-$2FFF. It's like saying "choose either WRAM or VRAM, not both, if your game's text isn't written in Japanese" because there's no such thing as NES-TNROM. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") 09:31, 3 June 2012 (PDT) 

    I suppose if you use NES 2.0 then you can have both. --[Zzo38](User_Zzo38.xhtml "User:Zzo38") ([talk](User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml "User talk:Zzo38")) 01:06, 29 June 2013 (MDT)
