Are we also going to put here games like: 

  * Doki Doki Yuuenchi (J) / Trolls In Crazyland (E)
  * Hebereke (J) / Ufouria (E)
  * Wanpaku Kokkun no Gourmet World (J) / Panic Restaurant (E)



and many more, which differ with changed sprites of main character and also many more? -[Krzysiobal](User_Krzysiobal.xhtml "User:Krzysiobal"), 2018 

## So guys...

This list is a complete mess. It should list individually games that adjusted the gameplay speed and music from those where there is ACTUAL significant regional differences, such as Castlevania games where the japanese version is COMPLETELY different from the western versions. 

Then the differences should be listed such as: Adjusted difficulty, fixed bugs, etc, etc... Actually I think the NES/FC games where there's no noticeable differences between regions are in minority. ESPECIALLY if adjusting the music or gameplay speed for PAL counts as a "difference".

## If Rainbow Islands, why not Maniac Mansion?

_Rainbow Islands_ is a different port between (U) and (E) versions. Isn't _Maniac Mansion_ the same situation between (J) and (U) versions? Or is only (E) worth mentioning because of TV system differences? --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 07:21, 31 October 2018 (MDT) 

    The list had just been created by Krzysobial and it is far from being complete right now.[Bregalad](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bregalad&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Bregalad \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_Bregalad.xhtml "User talk:Bregalad")) 04:26, 1 November 2018 (MDT)
