## Haunted Halloween 86 as an example?

Haunted Halloween 86 is not a freely released ROM, or I'm not sure if it's ever been released as a ROM. What exactly is the value of using something as an example that almost nobody would have to test their emulator with? - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 13:23, 29 December 2016 (MST)
