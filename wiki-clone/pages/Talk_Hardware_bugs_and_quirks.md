## Don't we already have a page for this?

Does the goal of this page differ in any way from the existing page: [Errata](Errata.xhtml "Errata")? Maybe it would be better to merge or rename than start another page with duplicated and/or mysteriously slightly different information? - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 11:22, 29 October 2015 (MDT) 

    I didn't know [Errata](Errata.xhtml "Errata") existed when I made it. It wasn't exactly easy to find until the creation of this page prompted its addition to [NES reference guide](NES_reference_guide.xhtml "NES reference guide"). - [Furrykef](User_Furrykef.xhtml "User:Furrykef") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Furrykef&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Furrykef \(page does not exist\)")) 10:46, 31 October 2015 (MDT)

    

    Yeah! Link it from anywhere that it should be seen. A lot of good information on this wiki is a bit buried from not being cross-referenced enough. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 11:17, 31 October 2015 (MDT)

## Bit 6 of $2000 can damage the PPU???

  * _Setting bit 6 of PPUCTRL ($2000) on a stock NES can potentially damage the PPU._



Can you explain how this can happen, or otherwise provide a source for this statement? - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 11:24, 29 October 2015 (MDT) 

    [PPU registers#Master/slave mode and the EXT pins](PPU_registers.xhtml#Master/slave_mode_and_the_EXT_pins "PPU registers"). Should put this into [Errata](Errata.xhtml "Errata"). —[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") ([talk](User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml "User talk:Lidnariq")) 12:44, 29 October 2015 (MDT)
