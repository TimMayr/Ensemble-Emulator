## Linear like that

In the changelog, Tepples wrote: "If it is linear like that and not switchable, then the internal organization into 2 KiB, 2 KiB, and 1 KiB banks doesn't matter from the ROM's or emulator's POV any more than the GameCube 1T-SRAM's organization into 4 KiB banks does"

What do you mean when you say "not switchable"? Since you made the change, I assume you don't mean the part where the slices can be enabled or disabled independently. (Not bankswitchable?)—[Lidnariq](User_Lidnariq.xhtml "User:Lidnariq") 00:06, 10 October 2012 (MDT) 

    Yes, I was referring to bank switching. --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") 05:51, 10 October 2012 (MDT)
