[![B&](../wiki-images/Banned_icon.png)](File_Banned_icon_png.xhtml "B&") | This user has been **blocked from editing** because {{{1}}}.   
---|---  
  
If a user has ~~been blocked~~ , put this at the top of the user page: 
    
    
    {{blocked user|some reason}}
    

Note that adding this template to a user page _does not_ block the user; only an administrator can do that.
