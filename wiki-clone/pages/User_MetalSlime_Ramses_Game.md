## Story

Ramses (the hero) was kidnapped from his home by space pirates and sold at a slave auction in the Artajian system to a cruel master named Bonehammer. Now he finds himself on a monster-infested planet, trapped in a strange prison with a bomb strapped to his chest. He sees a hammer in the corner of the room. Curious, he picks up the hammer and the game for his life begins… 

## Gameplay

_Ramses Game_ is based on a _Dragon Quest_ 5 (DS) minigame called Slime Smack, which is basically a touch-pen Whack-a-mole game with slimes. There is a game board with several holes. Monsters come out of the holes and you have to whack them in a specific order before the timer runs out. 

The NES doesn't have a touch-pen, so each hole is assigned a button combination (up+A, down+A, left+A, right+A, etc). Pressing a combination whacks the corresponding hole. 

## Characters

  * Ramses - good guy
  * Bonehammer - not so good guy



## Enemies

Ramses Game will have several different monster types with different stats and speeds, requiring the player to do some quick-thinking problem solving to whack them all in the correct sequence before time runs out. 

If I can figure out a good way to work them in, I'd like to have bosses too.
