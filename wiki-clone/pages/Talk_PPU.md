## Nametable evaluation page?

Would anyone have any objections if I looked at Brad Taylor's doc, digested the info, and stuck some of it up here? We have a page for sprite evaluation, but we don't have one for nametable evaluation. (If we do, I don't know where) --[Drag](User_Drag.xhtml "User:Drag") 06:20, 3 April 2011 (UTC) 

    Yeah, feel free to expand [PPU nametables#Background evaluation](PPU_nametables.xhtml#Background_evaluation "PPU nametables"). --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") 13:26, 3 April 2011 (UTC) 

    Ok cool. I'm going to make it its own seperate page though, since there's a lot more involved than just the nametables. --[Drag](User_Drag.xhtml "User:Drag") 18:25, 3 April 2011 (UTC)

A link to [The skinny on NES scrolling](PPU_scrolling.xhtml "The skinny on NES scrolling") would probably be nice here.

Okay if I link a Visual 2C02 page here and put up the tutorial I made in [http://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9901&start=60](http://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9901&start=60)? --[Ulfalizer](User_Ulfalizer.xhtml "User:Ulfalizer") ([talk](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ulfalizer&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Ulfalizer \(page does not exist\)")) 20:49, 19 March 2013 (MDT)
