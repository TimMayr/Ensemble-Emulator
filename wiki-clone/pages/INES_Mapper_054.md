# INES Mapper 054

Nestopia's source claims that iNES Mapper 054 was allocated for the board containing the multicart _Novel Diamond 9999999-in-1_. However, its implementation is what Disch's notes say for [iNES Mapper 201](INES_Mapper_201.xhtml "INES Mapper 201"). 

(In turn, Nestopia's implementation of mapper 201 is halfway between what Disch's notes say for m201 and [iNES Mapper 226](INES_Mapper_226.xhtml "INES Mapper 226")) 

GoodNES 3.1.4 and FCEUX 2.2.2 have nothing allocated to mapper 54, and only have Novel Diamond as a [UNIF](UNIF.xhtml "UNIF") dump with MAPR "BMC-NovelDiamond9999999in1".
