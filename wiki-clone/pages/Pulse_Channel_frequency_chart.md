## MIDI Tuning Table

Using the [MIDI Tuning Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_tuning_standard) with A=440 Hz, we can derive the equivalent period timer value for the two [ Pulse](APU_Pulse.xhtml "APU Pulse") channels. Due to limitations on the 11-bit period's range, the lowest standard MIDI frequency that can be reproduced with acceptable tuning is A-1 (55 Hz) on NTSC, and G#1 (51.91 Hz) on PAL. Here we show the desired frequency for each MIDI index, the closest period value, and the resulting tuning error (in cents) from the standard. 

**Note** : The [ Triangle](APU_Triangle.xhtml "APU Triangle") channel can make use of the same 11-bit period values. Due to its longer 32-step sequence, it will sound exactly one octave lower (half of the apparent frequency) compared to the equivalent period on Pulse.

## Code Friendly Tables

Here are the period values from the above table in ca65 syntax, split into low/high byte halves for convenient indexing. 

**Note** : These include every MIDI index from 0-127. This means the first ~32 entries in the table contain nonsense values, as the equivalent periods are larger than the range of the 11-bit timer. Programmers may wish to trim these early entries to save space.
