I had a different setup for this mapper, much like what Nintendulator does. Looks like the mapper info described here (and Kevtris) doesn't work, _at least in my emulator_. Anything written at **$8000-$9FFF** selects the PRG ROM block. Anything written at **$A000-$FFFF** selects the PRG ROM page. I didn't edit the wiki page, since I need confirmation from someone. --[Zepper](User_Zepper.xhtml "User:Zepper") 19:41, 3 March 2012 (PST)
