This page was created with a good intention of cleaning up the mirroring page, and I thank Rainwarrior for that. However, this raises a new (unrelated) question. Is it in scope of the wiki to do List of games by xxx ? 

Then we could do list of games by mapper, list of games by genres, list of games by publisher/developer list of games by sprite size (8x8 or 8x16), and so on and so forth. I do believe this kind of lists can be useful and interesting, for instance, Bootgod's databse is extremely useful in listing games by mapper or board or other hardware related factors. 

However, we have to know that there is more than 1500 FC/NES games officially, and much more if we include pirated games sold in 3rd world countries (and I know someone will include them eventually). Do we really want to maintain lists of such games?[Bregalad](https://www.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bregalad&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Bregalad \(page does not exist\)") ([talk](User_talk_Bregalad.xhtml "User talk:Bregalad")) 02:58, 18 May 2015 (MDT) 

    I don't want to maintain it, myself, but that's not why I created the article. Bootgod only contains mirroring information from iNES headers, it'll never have information on rendering techniques, so I do think this article could be potentially useful. I wanted to create a space where PGCX864 can contribute the wealth of minutiae he seems to be interested in, organized in a place where it can be useful on its own, rather than becoming a detriment-by-verbosity in an importan reference article like [Mirroring](Mirroring.xhtml "Mirroring"). It's not a great article at the moment, but I think it has potential, and isn't harming the wiki. - [Rainwarrior](User_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User:Rainwarrior") ([talk](User_talk_Rainwarrior.xhtml "User talk:Rainwarrior")) 12:00, 18 May 2015 (MDT)
