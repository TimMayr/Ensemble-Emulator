I don't think the new format is appropriate. I see what you want to do, to try to show what is the project and description but to me it feels more like cluttering the visual than anything. I think the previous approach was simple and obvious enough. We should revert to the previous design. [Banshaku](User_Banshaku.xhtml "User:Banshaku") 01:28, 4 November 2009 (UTC) 

Can we bump the "homebrew" section so it's above the "demo" section? I would think that current homebrew would be more popular than the older tech demos. --[Drag](User_Drag.xhtml "User:Drag") 22:34, 7 April 2011 (UTC)
