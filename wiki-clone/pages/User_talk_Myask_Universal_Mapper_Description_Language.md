## Reinventing Verilog much?

Wouldn't it be better to just define component names for the cart edge, ROMs, RAMs, and CIC for a Verilog description of a mapper to use? --[Tepples](User_Tepples.xhtml "User:Tepples") ([talk](User_talk_Tepples.xhtml "User talk:Tepples")) 17:08, 15 July 2016 (MDT) 

    It did strike me that way. This was an idea I should have sat on and brewed longer. Odds are I'll just end up making macros/a program to write the output file(s) instead of making a whole language. —[Myask](User_Myask.xhtml "User:Myask") ([talk](User_talk_Myask.xhtml "User talk:Myask")) 18:26, 19 July 2016 (MDT)
