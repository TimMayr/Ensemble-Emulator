_**Videomation**_ is a paint program for NES using the [CPROM](CPROM.xhtml "CPROM") board, published by THQ in 1991. 

It can be seen as the spiritual predecessor of _Mario Paint_. It has no save feature; the extra battery-backed RAM that would be needed was seen as an unnecessary cost in the VHS era. It has no [mouse](Mouse.xhtml "Mouse") support, but instead a button can be pressed to toggle among various cursor speeds (much as in _Image Fight_), and one of the pens has "race car" style control. Animation is with one of eight predefined sprites, and music depends on the animation. The fill tool is extremely slow.
